&lt;/center&gt;

This week on the blog we are yet again visiting Plot Coffee Roasters - a near constant feature in the blog as of late. This time we have a rather neat competition winning lot from Peru. The lot is from Laura Nilva Paye located in the Puno department of the country. In terms of location this is the south easterly corner of Peru, close to the border with Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultivar of this coffee is Bourbon. I have been reminded that my sloppy use of the word &quot;varietal&quot; is technically incorrect when referring to coffee. In layman's terms the difference between &quot;varietal&quot; and &quot;cultivar&quot; is the presence of human intervention - in coffee (essentially) all coffee plants have been selectively bred, hence they should be referred to as &quot;cultivar&quot; as opposed to &quot;varietal&quot;. This is something I often forget and end up referring to varietal but I'll try and be more precise in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot label this coffee as a &quot;washed&quot; process, however looking into the details the coffee has been depulped and fermented for 20-24 hours before being washed. In that sense it is a little more &quot;honey&quot; than many washed coffees available. Following the washing stage the coffee is dried under shade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not hang around but get straight down to business: on the dry aroma I get sweet caramel and peaches, but they are very feint. Overall the coffee doesn't have a huge bouquet when compared to others, but it is very appealling I have a sense this will be a coffee I'll like. As I've said before the dry aroma (or lack thereof) doesn't necessarily align with what ends up in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into the filter; it is clear to see how much quality is in this cup. It is very clean and clear, every flavour is well defined. The first thing that hits me is the sweetness, it has a very sticky-sweet vibe like a really ripe peach or even a peach syrup. After the intial stone fruit hit subsides you're left with a stunning floral finish which is clean and long lasting. The notes from Plot say: &quot;a flavour profile more akin to Ethiopia than Peru&quot; and it is very hard to argue with that. In terms of acidity I would describe it as a medium, or it may be that all the sweetness just offsets it. Eitherway it is a very easy cup to drink but also has layers of complexity to keep you entertained. I find it's best enjoyed at a slightly cooler temperature, straight out of the brewer the flavours get a bit too muddled for my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto espresso: I found it basically impossible to get a bad shot out of this. You can basically pull it however you like, with any grind setting and it'll be great. I was without electricity for a day and even pulled a shot on my cafelat robot and it was perhaps the best shot I had. I love the robot as a manual espresso maker, but I struggle with the lighter filter roasts I favour for espresso because it is hard to keep the temperature high enough. No problem with this coffee though, it still extracted perfectly. I found most enjoyment pulling the shots a little shorter that 1:2 to get a more luxurious caramel mouthfeel. The flavour profile in the cup is pure condensed peach and apricot. It is like a shot of peach syrup, incredibly high sweetness, just enough balancing acidity and no harshness at all. As much as I enjoyed this coffee in a filter, for me it really shone as an espresso - up there with the best of the year so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we're heading back to a classic Blue Note recording from 1965 - &quot;Basra&quot; by Pete La Roca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/050-Basra/Basra.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete &quot;La Roca&quot; Sims is a drummer/percussionist - he is best known as a sideman having appeared alongside some of the all time greats: Sonny Rollins (Roca appeared albeit briefly on &quot;Live at the Vanguard&quot;), Joe Henderson (on &quot;Page One&quot;), Jackie McLean, Bill Evans, Sonny Clark and so on. He started his career however playing in latin bands, an influence that came through in his playing throughout his career. There are a few things interesting about Pete: firstly he despised the name &quot;La Roca&quot; - he came up with the moniker early in his career and it is how most people knew him, but he regretted it in later life. Secondly he was in some sense a &quot;part timer&quot; - throughout the 60s he made money as an NY taxi driver and later became a lawyer in the 70s returning to jazz just once after this.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3M1O7InNT14&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;La Roca&quot; only has 3 albums under his own name, and one of those was erroniously labelled as a &quot;Chick Corea&quot; album by the record label initially. It's for that reason I consider &quot;Basra&quot; to be a bit of an &quot;under the radar classic&quot;. I'm not a fan of labels like &quot;under the radar&quot; or &quot;underrated&quot; since they always bring out arguments of &quot;XXXX is less well known, so this isn't underrated&quot; eventually devolving into an excuse for showing how obscure ones musical tastes are. I consider &quot;Basra&quot; an &quot;under the radar classic&quot; however, because almost every &quot;experienced&quot; jazz fan I know loves the album but it will rarely (if ever) feature on a &quot;top 100 albums&quot; list and &quot;La Roca&quot; will never feature in a list of artists you &quot;have to hear&quot; - as a result this is an album that many do not discover until much later in their jazz journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes the album so special? Firstly the line up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pete &quot;La Roca&quot; - Drums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Henderson - Tenor Sax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steve Swallow - Bass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steve Kuhn - Piano
As with many Blue Note recordings from around this time: a true heavyweight line-up. But more than that: &quot;Basra&quot; features some truly explorative playing. It is not your typical &quot;hard bop&quot; album, the is a darker brooding attitude and vibe throughout. The players also lean into the avant-garde/free styles more than many other albums of the period. But more than that there are influences outside of the typical &quot;jazz&quot; paradigm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps most evident in the title track &quot;Basra&quot; (embedded at the start of the blog). A take on Middle Eastern classical music it is based around one chord and captures the &quot;meditative&quot; essence of the style. The &quot;blank canvas&quot; allows Joe to carve out any line he wants and it is some of the best lead playing you'll hear from Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the firey &quot;Malaguena&quot; (above) which is a piece originally penned by Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona (again &quot;La Roca&quot; tipping his hat towards the latin music he played in his early career.) Again Joe plays out of his skin and there are plenty of &quot;Henderson-isms&quot; throughout which is no bad thing. The piece manages to be energetic without being high tempo, the quartet masterfully keeps racheting up the tension as it goes on but somehow manages to swing. 

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/briljflpx2s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Basra&quot; also features the original recording of the Swallow tune: &quot;Eiderdown&quot; which later went on to be a Swallow signature tune and a standard in its own right. It is interesting to hear it in its &quot;original&quot; form here. It is perhaps the most &quot;straight ahead&quot; of all the tunes on the album and Swallow's bass keeps the tune driving forward in his own inimitable way. This is also one of the recordings shortly before Steve switched to electric bass entirely, so it is nice to hear him play with an acoustic instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all &quot;Basra&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the greatest recordings on Blue Note. Definitely hunt out a copy through whatever medium you use to consume your music. It is a shame we have so few records of &quot;La Roca&quot; under his own name, it would have been great to see where he would have taken his music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are back with another installment of the KaffeBox subscription. Recall the KaffeBox subscription highlights a different Scandinavian roaster each month. This month was particularly exciting for me since it featured one of my all time favourite roasters: Morgon Coffee Roasters - who I do not buy from nearly enough due to the logistics of getting the coffee here to London. The roastery is located in Gotherburg, Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I noticed about Morgon is their aesthetic vision. Everything from their website, to instagram account to the bags themselves are really well put together. Each bag is blue in colour and features a picture depicting the flavour profile of the coffee inside. The images are really works of art in themselves, and this gives the impression of great quality even before opening the bag. As an example, here is an image from one of the bags we are looking at today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/049-Sun-Blowing/Ferney-Cruz.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly some of the best looking packaging out there in my mind. As with previous KaffeBox subscriptions I have 2 different 125g bags to play around with. This is not enough to dial in an espresso and make filter coffees with so I split the coffees - one for espresso duties and one for filter duties. This time I did it at random, when making the first filter coffee I just reached for a bag on the shelf and that's how it was assigned. Note that both coffees are &quot;filter&quot; roast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the filter option: we have a washed Ethiopian coffee from the Uraga Raro washing station located in the Guji zone - an area that crops up frequently on this blog. Morgon don't provide much more information than that, which is not a problem - we can move swiftly on to what matters: the coffee itself. On the dry aroma you get your &quot;typical&quot; washed Ethiopian qualities: citrus fruits and florals. As you would expect it is not a really punchy hard hitting coffee on the nose. In the cup you get everything you expect from a coffee like this: elegant earl-grey tea-like flavours, citrus-y blood orange and grapefruit sharpness and a very refined balance to the cup. This is just a top drawer example of what washed Ethiopian coffees are all about, there is so much clarity it allows the complexity to come through and allows you to enjoy the cup at the cooler temperatures. This is what I like and respect about the Morgon offerings I've had in the past - they're just completely dependable. They seem to respect the origin and each one is a top quality example of what a particular region is all about. No nonsense, just really good quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the espresso side we have a washed Caturra from Colombia - Ferney Cruz. Again not a whole lot of information here so we'll dive right in. On the nose I get hits of sweet &quot;red&quot; fruits like strawberry, raspberry and rhubarb, again it's not a big hitter but certainly enough to draw you in. Dialing this one in for espresso was a bit of a pain, this is a coffee where you need to set your grinder very fine. I was just past the point of burrs touching and I could just about wrestle a 1:2 in 27s sort of profile out of it. Being a filter roast however, it seems to benefit from a bit of a longer pull. 1:2.5 seems to work best in around 25s with the machine at full temperature. The resulting shot is syrupy sweet. The flavour profile is full of raspberry and rhubarb - if you imagine a pineapple cube sweet but made with rhubarb I don't think you'd be far off the mark. Again the coffee is very clean, especially in the aftertaste - qualities I like in a coffee. Again it is just a very very good example of a clean washed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to drink some more Morgon coffees this month, it reminds me that I should order from them more often. If you're after &quot;fireworks&quot;, crazy processing, loud punchy flavours - Morgon probably aren't the ones to go to (at least in my experience). But if you want complete quality and elegant clean cups Morgon are certainly up there with the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week I found myself digging out an album from 2016 by the trio of Lars Danielsson, Marius Neset and Morten Lund on the ACT label - &quot;Sun Blowing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/049-Sun-Blowing/Sun-Blowing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story behind this album is that Danielsson, Neset and Lund met by chance on a train in 2012 - they had not met each other before, let alone played together. Two years after this happy accident they decided to record &quot;Sun Blowing&quot; - representing an &quot;intial encounter&quot; in the studio. The line-up here represents a &quot;tenor-sax-trio&quot; format with Neset on tenor, Danielsson on bass and Lund on drums. We have spoken about trio formats like this in the past on this blog - many sax players try and play in this context but few succeed. With so much space and freedom it really exposes the sax so you need to be on top of your game. Neset, however, is no ordinary sax player. A bit of a &quot;prodigy&quot; and one of the most accomplished young sax players out there. In contrast to his solo work which typically contains large ensembles, it is rare to see Neset play in such an intimate setting.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqCQnjVxXQE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Being a &quot;first encounter&quot; there is a lot of energy and vibrancy on show on the album. As you'd expect from a trio of this format there is a big influence from the tenor greats: Coltrane, Rollins, Brecker, Henderson and so on. However there is also a lot of influence from the avant-garde and free sides too particularly from the early ECM records. While it would be easy to release an album of Neset just blowing over changes and showing off his chops, the guys here have worked on creating actual tunes. I think of Neset as a very thematic player, although he has chops his primary focus seems to be on creating themes and movements in the music. This gives his playing a &quot;story-telling&quot; sort of quality, this makes the tunes very memorable and they often stick in your head for days after hearing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with &quot;Little Jump&quot; (embedded at the start of this post), here Neset's playing is somewhere between Sonny Rollins and Michael Brecker. In the rhythm section Danielsson plays some of the grooviest, funkiest bass lines on the album and drives the tune forward. Behind it all however is Lund's modulating drum beat, he pulls and drags the time throughout masterfully. The interplay between Danielsson and Lund throughout is incredible also, it almost feels like a live gig with the energy flowing between the trio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tune of note on the album is &quot;Up North&quot; (above), the main theme of which has a folk/Americana sort of vibe. This is an influence that comes up a few times throughout the album, this is even in reflected in the title of one of the pieces &quot;Folksong&quot;. On &quot;Up North&quot; there is more than a hint of Joe Henderson to Neset's playing - if you're familiar with this blog you'll know I see this as no bad thing.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_FPZZx0oos&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Sun Blowing&quot; is comprised entirely of original pieces apart from the Don Grolnick penned &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; (above) which closes the album. This is one of the lower tempo pieces on the album and it features some beautiful soloing from Danielsson. We are also treated to a masterclass from Lund who builds the energy just enough to punctuate the crescendo of each solo before bringing us back down again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a jazz album you may have missed in the last decade, &quot;Sun Blowing&quot; is definitely worth your time. It's a little hard to believe this album is 5 years old (7 since it was recorded) - but it still sounds fresh. Given the energy and &quot;story-telling&quot; nature of the tunes it is an easy listen that does not require too much attention. Well worth hunting down a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we're heading back to the Brew Coffee Plus roasters in Streatham. For the second week in a row we're looking at a Gesha varietal coffee - but this time a washed processed example. We have talked about Gesha a few times in the past so we won't retread that ground - suffice to say the past few weeks of coffee have been relatively expensive so I might have to avoid the super-rare lots for a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss if I did not first mention the packaging for this coffee. Since this is a special Gesha coffee, Brew Coffee Plus decided to pull out all the stops with the packaging. The coffee arrived in a thick cardboard box with a magnetic clasp, it reminds me more of a hardback book than it does a coffee box. Yes, it is superfluous and doesn't actually &quot;add&quot; anything to the coffee itself - but I'm a firm believer that subconciously you judge a coffee long before it even reaches the cup and so this certainly does no harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself is from Finca La Esmeralda in Acatenango, Chimaltenango, Guatemala. Seeing the words &quot;La Esmeralda&quot; and &quot;Gesha&quot; on the same page will likely make one think of &quot;Hacienda La Esmeralda&quot; in Panama - but this coffee is unrelated (aside from the obvious sharing of the Gesha varietal). There wasn't too much information provided with the coffee itself but it does state that the owner of the farm is one Mr Hermes and it provides an interesting tidbit that he is working with hybrid varietals. Potentially something to look out for in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive into the coffee itself: in the usual way starting with the dry aroma. The first thing I notice is the nuance in the coffee. You can tell this will be a complex cup from the moment of opening the bag. There are layers upon layers of florals and citrus notes. It's quite hard to pinpoint individual notes here as there is a lot going on, but it is very inviting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a filter this coffee really shines. It is an incredibly clean cup of coffee, one of the cleanest I've had in a while. The main two &quot;themes&quot; of flavour notes are citrus and florals. I would describe the citrus notes as being clemantine in terms of sweetness but with a grapefruit type acidity in their too. You could also argue various other citrus-y type notes too but those are the two that come to mind for me. Once the initial citrus hit subsides you're hit with a wave of florals - jasmines are certainly there and there's a certain honeysuckle type sticky sweetness on show too. The taste notes say &quot;bergamot&quot; which is also a good description. The cup is very complex so picking out a few taste notes is difficult. This cup is also super sensitive to temperature and it takes you on a journey when drinking it. Using any sort of temperature control mug would be a crime against coffee here. I would instead recommend getting a very thin walled drinking vessel so that it cools down quicker as it won't last long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had enough of this coffee that I could experiment with espresso too. It is a roast that is on the lighter end and has delicate floral taste notes which can sometimes lead to a difficult dialing in process. I found the coffee very forgiving however, most things seemed to work well. Ultimately though a longer shot of around 1:2.75 in about 25s worked best for me and the machine wanted to be as hot as it could go. Going too short with this one led to something too concentrated and it was hard to identify the flavours for me. The bit of extra liquid helped seperate the flavour notes - again a similar palette of flavours to the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another super enjoyable Gesha coffee and another good showing from Brew Coffee Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we're looking at a 2020 release from Lewis Wright called &quot;The Colour of Intention&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/048-Colour-of-Intention/Colour-of-Intention.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis Wright is perhaps best known as being the vibraphone player in the UK jazz group &quot;Empirical&quot; - one of the more interesting UK jazz groups of the past few decades, playing music inspired by some of the free and avant garde artists as well as the more straight ahead. On &quot;The Colour of Intention&quot; however we get to see Wright in a more stripped down setting - he is joined by two fantastic musicians in the form of Matt Brewer on the bass (one of my favourite bassists) and Marcus Gilmore on the drums. With only a 2 piece rhythm section to support him we get to hear what Wright has to offer unencumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this outing there is less in the way of &quot;free&quot; playing than you'd expect if you came here via &quot;Empirical&quot; - the majority on the playing is fairly &quot;inside&quot;. The one notable exception being the opening track &quot;Mettle&quot; (embedded at the start of the blog) which evokes Bobby Hutcherson on Eric Dolphy's &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; recording with it's circular repeating melody.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpUY3zsGGXg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

What really stands out throughout the album is the sheer virtuosity of Wright. He has some really enviable chops, but does not let that get in the way of the music. You never get the impression that he is &quot;showing off&quot; or trying to impress anybody. This is particularly evident by the rather notable final track on the album: &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot;. For those unfamiliar: this is a piece by Thelonious Monk. It is known for being so complicated that the musicians on the recording (including Sonny Rollins) were unable to play it end to end without making mistakes, and to my knowledge Monk never performed this piece live in its entirety. By placing this track on an album you are certainly making a statement about your jazz chops. The arrangement is very cool too, it captures the vibe and the frequent tempo changes/rhythmic motifs but Wright manages to throw his own spin on the tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with playing a relatively obscure instrument such as the vibraphone is you instantly get compared to those that came before. These days most will get compared to the late great Gary Burton given his reinvention of the instrument. While Wright is clearly influence by Burton  (perhaps most notably on the track &quot;Resolve&quot; (above) which has a tinge of &quot;Crystal Silence&quot; to it.) Wright has his own sound and voice that is his own.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYb6L9KuTM8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Another track that really stands out for me is the beautiful &quot;Raise (For Z)&quot; (above) - it is not about high octane virtuosity at all and is the most stripped back on the album. I'm particularly fond of Brewer's arco playing which is simply stunning, Wright makes sure to hold back during these parts to allow Brewer the chance to shine. Overall the piece has a dream-like almost meditative feeling to it and offers a stark contrast to the more uptempo numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall &quot;The Colour of Intention&quot; is a really great modern jazz release. If you like small band interaction it is a shining example of what can be achieved. There is a near telepathic interplay between the trio and each one is trying to help the others thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

After a brief month hiatus the Plot Roasters ICON series subscription is back! Owing to Brexit related supply chain issues this coffee was due to be released in February but unfortunately got delayed until March. Let's see if good things do indeed come to those who wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder this is the 3rd installment of the ICON series by Plot Roasters. This series is a relatively expensive series of rare and exciting coffees, it's for those who love coffee and don't mind paying to get access to the rare lots. In this installment we have a Gesha varietal from Panama. In the past we've talked about the rise of the Gesha varietal in the mid 2000s - and those with a good memory will recall that a particular lot from a Panamanian farm was responsible for causing the &quot;boom&quot;. It is therefore always interesting to get hold of some Gesha from Panama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance the Gesha was grown by the Hartmann family - one of the leading names in coffee in Panama, and their coffees always command high prices and achieve enviable cupping scores. The Hartmann family has owned farmland in Panama since the early 1900s, it now consists of many different coffee growing plots. The coffee we're talking about today is from the &quot;Roscosa Montana&quot; plot which translates to &quot;Rocky Mountain&quot; which borders the Parque Nacional de La Amistad rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself has been naturally processed - dried on raised African beds for a full 25 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous ICON installments this arrives in 150g bags only. As a result I don't use it for espresso since after a couple of shots to dial in I'd be left with very little to enjoy at its best! So it's a filter only blog-post this week. I have been drinking a great espresso alongside this one but I'll feature it next time in a dedicated post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving nose first into the dry aroma: the first thing to note is it smells incredible. The main hit is from tropical fruits, notably papaya and mango. But along with that there are caramel notes and a good floral bouquet. You can tell this is a very complex coffee before even taking a sip. Although it's a natural process there is not a hint of funkiness however, it seems very clean for a natural coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving into the filter: this coffee is truly exquisite. The supply chain delays seem irrelevant on first sip - it is well worth the wait. The first wave of flavour that hits is the tropical fruit notes from the nose. Papaya and Mango are most prevalent but there is also a sharpness to it too, perhaps a passionfruit. But in the supporting cast I also noted down wild strawberries and I could even be argued into agreeing the sharpness has a raspberry quality. What is so interesting about this coffee however is that the floral notes stand up to these big tropical fruit notes - I get strong violet and lavendar vibes from this one. It is very very rare to find a coffee where the florals don't get overwhelmed by the bigger bolder flavours. This makes for a super interesting and complex cup. As the cup cools down the balance between the fruit and the floral changes, the cooler you go the more florals you pick up. This is a coffee that demands you to savour and watch the flavour profiles develop, drinking this in a temperature controlled ember mug would be an absolute travesty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again Plot have smashed it out of the park. Looking forward to see what is to come with future ICON releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side we're going to look at another icon: Wayne Shorter with his 1966 release &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/047-All-Seeing-Eye/All-Seeing-Eye.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Wayne Shorter is certainly one of the elder-statesmen of jazz. Nearing in on his 90th birthday he has a career spanning around 70 years. During that time we has released solo works, been a member of both Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (with whom he became the primary composer for the band) and Miles Davis' band - along with being a founding member of one of the greatest fusion groups of all time in Weather Report. &quot;Star studded career&quot; isn't nearly enough to describe what Shorter has achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very start of his career Shorter was seen as &quot;just another Coltrane tribute act&quot; - a label that (rather unfairly) was attributed to many tenor players of that era. As his career developed it was clear Wayne was anything but. Instead of relying on flashy, complicated, virtuosic playing (although he certainly had chops) - Shorter is now best known for his compositional voice. You can argue that he is one the greatest composers in all of jazz, if not all of music. His compostional style is focussed heavily on harmony, and using this to create a &quot;mood&quot;. A few albums before &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; he released perhaps his most famous album &quot;Speak No Evil&quot; where he explores the modal jazz style. Although his later works can't really be considered &quot;modal&quot; in the same way you can tell the modal style of creating a mood for a piece stuck with Shorter.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylc6_wPm6SA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; marks Wayne's 9th solo outing, and to date his most ambitious. From the get-go it is clear this is not your run of the mill bop record but something new entirely. It makes some nods from the avant-garde and free movements but the compositions are much more structured than is often the case in those styles. It is a highly ambitious record that still sounds daring today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening title track (embedded at the start of this post) sets the tone for the rest of the record. In interviews Wayne has stated the entire album is an attempt to depict the meaning of life, creation and the nature of god. The solos on the title track thus represent &quot;the machinery involved in the process of creation&quot; - with other tracks on the album showing similar levels of symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most &quot;traditional&quot; bop-sounding track on the album is &quot;Chaos&quot; (above) - living up to its name it's a chaotic fire-breathing sort of piece which allows the stellar cast to flex their chops. The supporting cast on the album features: Freddie Hubbard on trumpet/flugelhorn, Grachan Moncur III on trombone, James Spaulding on alto, Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass and Joe Chambers on drums (with a cameo from Wayne's brother Alan on one piece). This is an enviable line-up of talent and the quality shows throughout, although the music is highly daring and experimental it never feels out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; represents one of my favourite Wayne Shorter albums and it is well worth your time. It is likely music you'll have to put the effort in to appreciate however, and it commands your attention. But it is an album that will reward your effort so it's worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are welcoming a new coffee roaster to the blog: Brew Coffee Plus. Located in Streatham, South London - these guys have been on my radar for a while but I haven't got round to trying them. They tick a few boxes for things I typically look for in a roaster: a concise offering, focusing on quality over quantity. Plus their packaging is attractive but simple. You can read more about them on their website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://brewcoffeeplus.com/&quot;&gt;https://brewcoffeeplus.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I opted for one of their Colombian offerings - Villa Betvlia - a Caturra microlot that has been naturally processed. The farm is located in Huila, a &quot;hotspot&quot; for coffee within the country. The bag/website does not offer much in the way of back story behind this coffee, fitting with Brew Plus Coffee's minimalist aesthetic, so I don't really know much more about this coffee. So I guess we should just dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the nose the first thing that hits you is big juicy tropical fruits. It is not a really intense &quot;fruit bomb&quot; aroma but more like a very nice tropical fruit salad. Although the tropical fruits hint towards natural processing methods you do not get the boozy/funky natural notes you often get. I also notice a caramel note in the supporting cast. Very appetising. In terms of roast level we are in a light range, but it is not super light/nordic by any means - not quite medium-light but getting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving swiftly onto the filter: again the over-arching flavour notes are tropical fruits. I get mango and pineapple most of all - the sweeter end of the tropical fruit range. There is also the passion fruit type acidity to matters but primarily I would say this is on the sweeter end rather than the acidic end. If you imagine a tropical fruit salad covered in a sugar-syrup you wouldn't be far off. The body and mouthfeel are in the medium sort of range, it is not completely absent but neither is it a coffee you need to chew. The aftertaste is fairly intense and lingering. Temperature wise I find this coffee is fairly linear - it has the same character hotter or cooler so it's one you can drink at your leisure. Overall it is not hugely complex but is certainly very drinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an espresso this might be one of the easiest coffees to dial in I've experienced. It can take pretty much whatever I threw at it in terms of recipe. In the end I found that I liked a 1:2.1 ratio with a 7s pre-infuse followed with a 32-34s pull - on the temperature scale I'm medium-high. This is not normally how I like to pull shots as it can introduce some bitterness or astringency to the finish but this is a coffee that can take it. You're rewarded with a thicker more luxurious shot and more intensity compared to my more usual longer/quicker style of pull. Again the tropical fruit salad and sugary sweetness comes through in the espresso, the acidity is slightly more noticable in the espresso but it is still a sweet coffee first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall a very enjoyable coffee, hopefully a sign of things to come from this roaster and one I'm sure I'll be heading back to based on this showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our jazz record this week we are heading back to 1973 and guitarist George Benson with his release: &quot;Body Talk&quot; on CTI records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/046-Body-Talk/Body-Talk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are new to the world of jazz you might be surprised to see George Benson recommended on a jazz-blog. For many he will be synonymous with pop records such as &quot;Give Me The Night&quot; or his &quot;crooner&quot; image from his later works. It is easy to forget he has some serious jazz under his belt also. When he burst onto the scene in the 1960s he was considered a protege to Wes Montgomery in some respects. George's &quot;twin careers&quot; of jazz star and pop star came to a head a few years ago at a gig in London whereby he was unable to sing so played a set of instrumental jazz pieces and the (non-jazz) crowd booed him for not playing his &quot;hits&quot; - a rather embarrassing incident for the London live music scene and those involved should be ashamed.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HV1Tfj8qqtI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Body Talk&quot; is one of my favourite Benson albums. It marks a kind of &quot;cross-over&quot; period from the more straight ahead jazz he was playing before and the RnB and pop influenced music that came after. I wish he spent a bit more time exploring this soul-jazz kind of space as he was very good at it. On this album Benson entrusted James Brown alumni - saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis to write and arrange a few of the tunes. But it is clear that the James Brown DNA heavily influenced Benson at the time since all the tracks feature the strong grooves we associate with Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album also features some heavyweight jazz icons in the supporting cast: Jack DeJohnette taking control of the drumming duties - one of the most prolific jazz drummers of all time. Jack manages to introduce a slight swing to proceedings while keeping the muscular grooves driving forward, something that is not easy to do by any means. Alongside is Ron Carter on the acoustic bass (the album also features Gary King on electric bass). We've spoken about Ron in the blog before, as a bass player he is completely reliable and can throw his hand at anything - another jazz legend. On the electric piano we also have Harold Mabern. He is one of the underappreciated greats, a lot of his work has been as a sideman rather than a leader. I was fortunate enough to be able to meet him before he passed away - a great musician and a great person. I'll save my Harold story for another day when we can focus on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with &quot;Dance&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) and straight away gets into a deep groove. You can tell that Benson had an eye on making music you can move to here, it's almost impossible to not tap your foot along to the beat. However, it features an absolutely virtuousic guitar performance throughout. I consider Benson as one of the most naturally gifted guitar players of all time. There appears to be absolutely no filter between brain and guitar, it comes across as completely effortless. This is backed up by watching some of his incomprehensible guitar tuition videos - it is so natural he is completely unable to effectively explain what he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another track that is particularly interesting on the album is the third number: &quot;Plum&quot; (above). This really exemplifies the two worlds of jazz and RnB that Benson is trying to straddle. It starts off in a swinging jazz tune but eventually the horns and percussion come in, the groove hits and we're comfortably in foot-tapping mode again. This is not a jarring experience of slamming two styles together - the transition is seamless. Again Benson throws out some mindblowing guitar lines as all this is unfolding.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/li5IDW_H_6s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Perhaps the hardest hitting groove is the title track &quot;Body Talk&quot; (above). Here we have a piece that is part James Brown groove and part Latin jazz. It's 8 minutes of pure energy and intensity. While there is incredible musicianship on display, the main theme is itself catchy and something you'll likely be humming to yourself after hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Body Talk&quot; is a bit of an underappreciated jazz album, from his &quot;jazz&quot; period other Benson albums such as &quot;Beyond Blue Horizon&quot; often get more publicity - but for me &quot;Body Talk&quot; is where Benson hits his stride. If you do not know anything of George Benson's jazz career I'd strongly suggest giving it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we're heading back to Plot Coffee Roasting again. A few blog posts ago we featured the rather special Champagne yeast processed coffee from Finca La Senda in Guatemala - this time we feature another experimental processed coffee from the very same farm. As before the coffee is of the Pache varietal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is described as a &quot;hydro-natrual&quot; - the cherries are picked and dried in the sun for 4 days before being soaked in water overnight. This &quot;rehydrates&quot; the cherries which are then dried in the shade for another 28-30 days. The folks at Finca La Senda are certainly experimental and they should be commended for it. I think processing variation is likely to be the key to unlocking new flavour potential in coffee. Of course genetic diversity of coffee plants can lead to variation but this is a slow process driven by evolution (aside from the rare &quot;freak discovery&quot; of an unknown varietal) - processing is something that has a shorter feedback loop and so is a more commercially viable for the farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit however I'm not a fan of all the experimental processings I've had. In fact I have a rather low hit rate of enjoyment from them, I often find them unbalanced or just plain odd. Based on the Champagne yeast processed coffee I have high hopes for this one however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets just dive straight into the coffee itself. Like the Champagne yeast offering Plot have opted for a pretty light roast, maybe a hair darker than the Champagne yeast but I never compared them side by side. On the dry aroma it is clear this is a very different beast. The first thing that I notice is the red berry note - it also has a sort of bramble note too, it reminds me of a fruit picking farm. In the background there is just a hint of tropical fruit, but it is not your typical &quot;fruit bomb&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual we start with a filter brew: just as on the nose the primary thing I notice is the red berry flavours. The label lists blueberry and raspberry, which I don't disagree with. The tropical fruit flavours are also more prominent in the cup, mango being the predominant note. On the acidity scale this one comes in quite high but it is balanced with a lot of sweetness. It also has quite a big mouthfeel and body. Interestingly I find this coffee is better at higher cup temperatures, usually I find the flavours difficult to distinguish at the higher temperatures but this coffee keeps its clarity. At lower cup temperatures the acidity can take over a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto espresso: as you'd expect for a light roast the machine temp is set to maximum. For a ratio I found 1:2.5 works best but I prefered to pull a bit slower than usual at around 30-32s. This allowed more of the body to come through and added some intensity to the shot. I didn't find this added any bitterness at all and everything balanced nicely. The flavour profile was much the same as the filter brew: mangos and raspberries. Despite being a fairly acidic light roast it is surprisingly easy to drink as an espresso and one I have enjoyed. The only downside to the espresso compared to the filter is less of the complexity comes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall another great offering. For me the Champagne yeast version was more up my street, but I could easily see others having the opposite preference. Drinking two coffees from the same farm with different processings is always interesting as you can see what a huge difference there is in the cup. These coffees are night and day different, in a blind tasting I don't think I'd be able to identify they were from the same farm. Plot offer a third processing from Finca La Senda (carbonic maceration) but unfortunately at the time I couldn't justify getting all three since I already had too much coffee to be getting on with. If it's still available next time I do a Plot order I'll pick up a bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we're heading back to an all time classic from 1957. The seminal &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; from Dizzy Gillespie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/045-Sonny-Side-Up/Sonny-Side-Up.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dizzy has featured on the blog in the past as a co-headliner but this is his first showing in his own right. Dizzy of course needs no introduction - one of the forefathers of be-bop, he is one of the few jazz artists who became known outside of the jazz community. Potentially down to his look: often sporting a beret, horn-rimmed glasses and of course the puffed out cheeks when playing. Or possibly down to his jovial and light hearted personality. But, there is no doubting his musical pedigree.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

By 1957 be-bop had pretty much run its course, it had become fairly &quot;mainstream&quot; in jazz by then so just playing be-bop was not enough to gain recognition. Jazz artists were beginning to look at the new &quot;post-bop&quot; world and where they could make their mark. For somebody like Dizzy who was one of the originators this could present a problem, it is often easy for an artist to get stuck in their stylistic box and unable to adapt with the times. To combat this Dizzy apointed two tenor saxophonists to help him out: Sonny Stitt and Sonny Rollins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides just providing am easy pun for the album's title the tenor pair provided the necessary artistic direction for the album. Both Sonny's were clearly disciples of Gillespie's buddy Charlie Parker - but instead of simply copying Bird licks they each developed upon the Parker framework in different ways. Stitt was most directly compared to Parker, originally playing alto he was often labelled a &quot;Parker Clone&quot;. To combat this he made the switch to the tenor and developed a more forceful approach, however he still adopted the belly-fire of Parker and made use of the wild lines we associate with be-bop. In contrast Rollins adapted the Parker ethos in a different way, he made use of the be-bop framework but explored thematic and motif led ideas. You could argue it is more of an intellectual approach, often adopting more complex harmonic devices and crafting lines that fall further from typical be-bop. Hearing the two tenor-men back-to-back is part of the joy of this album. You could never mistake one for the other since their styles are so different (although I believe one version of the liner notes did just that, stating that a Rollins solo appears first or vice versa) Yet both players serve the music being played and neither sounds out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With three titans in Gillespie, Rollins and Stitt - it would be easy to overlook the rest of the band: Ray Bryant on piano, Tommy Bryant on bass and Charlie Persip on drums. While these guys may not be &quot;headline acts&quot; as the others they do add to the quality of the album - so many albums featuring &quot;heavyweights&quot; fall down with poor supporting casts. This is particularly true for an album such as &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; where you have two tenor players battling each other for supremacy, the rhythm section needs to be tight and stay out of their way and that is certainly achieved here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; is afterall however a Dizzy Gillespie album so it is worth exploring a little bit of his role. The album is itself essentially a &quot;live&quot; studio album, all tracks were recorded in one take in a &quot;cutting session&quot; style. Reportedly before the date Dizzy did his best to rile up the rivalry between the Sonny's - important work to get the best out of the band. This all came to a head in the stand out tenor-duel on the track &quot;Eternal Triangle&quot;. For me this is Dizzy Gillespie's true talent: getting the best out of people. I do not believe Charlie Parker would have been nearly as revered as he is today without Gillespie. Dizzy worked out a lot of the harmonic complexities of be-bop which allowed Parker (and to a lesser extent Monk) to flourish.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8afBciyvAeA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Dizzy is of course no slouch on the trumpet either, this is particularly clear on his killer solo on &quot;After Hours&quot;. He manages to pull of an effortlessly cool and laidback blues led solo. Not something you instantly think of when you think of a Dizzy solo. Then of course you cannot ignore the trademark Gillespie humour and wit - on this album coming through in the opening track &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;. Here Gillespie completely reworks the standard both melodically and rhythmically to create a fresh take on a well-trodden classic. We also get to hear Dizzy stretch his vocal chords which is always intresting too. I can see many parallels between his vocal phrasing on this tune and the phrasing used in rap music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to this album is its brevity - clocking in at just over 30 minutes. It would have been great to have another cut or two on the album but it doesen't take away from the enjoyment. For the jazz historians and those interested in the progression of be-bop it is a very interesting recording, but it is also a great listen for those that just want to hear a great old-fashioned cutting session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This blog post marks a return to my KaffeBox subscription. This time it features a pair of coffees from Danish coffee roaster Clever Coffee. Not to be confused with the &quot;clever dripper&quot; brewer manufactured by a totally different company. I have to admit I'd never heard of Clever Coffee prior to receiving these coffees, part of the joy of a subscription service like KaffeBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging wise they opt for quite a minimalist aesthetic with plain white packages and green labels. For each coffee there is a different shade of green so I assume they might have other colours for other coffees. Overall I don't mind the presentation but it is not as eye-catching as some other packaging I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the previous KaffeBox offerings I received 2 bags of 125g each, I decide to dedicate one to filter and one to espresso so I have a chance to dial in and get the best out of them. This time I decided which coffee to use for each preparation completely at random - it was whichever I picked up first when brewing the first filter coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the filter side this week we have La Catarata - a red catuai varietal from Costa Rica. The processing method is described as &quot;black honey&quot; - I've covered honey processing in previous posts so won't retread old ground there. But the &quot;black&quot; designation is used to refer to the amount of fruit/mucilage left on the seed as part of the honey process. Very loosely: a white honey means that a lot of the cherry is removed (&quot;closer to a washed&quot;) and black honey means more cherry is left attached (&quot;closer to a natural&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to notice about this coffee is that it's certainly on the lighter end roast wise. On the dry aroma I get hints of caramel and honey along with a fig fruity note. It has a heft to the nose but it is not something you'll smell across a room when somebody opens the bag. In the cup the first thing to note is how balanced the cup is; acidity and sweetness are in perfect harmony. In terms of flavours I get apples and caramels most of all. You get the crisp sharpness of a green apple followed by the sweetness of the caramel. In terms of body I would describe this as a medium, given the roast level it has more body that you would expect. The aftertaste is very clean and fairly short lived. It is not the most complex coffee you'll ever drink and you don't really get anything in the way of progression as the cup cools. It is a very reliable no-nonsense sort of cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the espresso side we have Fazenda Samambaia - a Mundo Novo varietal from Brazil. What is interesting here is that it is an anaerobically processed coffee, I don't remember seeing many Brazilian coffees with this processing method. However, Brazil is not an origin I spend much time with typically. On opening the bag again I notice the light roast level and on the nose I get caramel notes but overall it is a pretty subtle affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of dialing this coffee in I have to admit it was a bit of a challenge (this is a light filter roast so that is not a complaint). This coffee is prone to getting a bit acidic so to combat that I had to set the machine to maximum temperature. Pulling the shot long helped with this also but the coffee has a great body that is sacrificed so I preferred to keep it more in the 1:2.5 range. When it's right it is fantastic and super interesting. I would describe the sensation as being like those traditional pineapple cube sweets - that sort of tropical fruit note combined with huge sweetness. I find that the mouthfeel starts off kind of thin but the body &quot;blooms&quot; and you're left satisfied. If you don't have it dialed in or your puck prep is not quite right you do end up with a &quot;battery acid&quot; shot however. This is one for somebody experienced at making espresso and doesn't mind a bit of work, but you will be rewarded for it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this weeks jazz we're jumping back to 2014 with Brian Blade and The Fellowship Band and their Landmarks recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/044-Landmarks/Landmarks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landmarks is the fourth release from The Fellowship Band having released their debut album in 1998. The heart of the band features Brian Blade on drums, Jon Cowherd on piano, Myron Walden on alto sax and bass clarinet, Melvin Butler on soprano and tenor sax and Chris Thomas on bass. They also feature the occassional &quot;guest&quot; spots notably in the guitarist spot - on this album we have Marvin Sewell and Jeff Parker who replace Kurt Rosenwinkel

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aEcLf-uoqAA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Drummer Brian Blade is of course the &quot;headline act&quot; for this band and, arguably, the most famous musician on the recording. He is perhaps best known as a sideman and particularly through being &quot;Wayne Shorter's drummer&quot; for many years. He has also been a long time member of the Chick Corea trio and has appeared alongside more modern greats such as Joshua Redman and Kenny Garrett, as well as appearing on Joni Mitchell records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian's drumming style is both interesting and distinctive. A big part of his vibe is his use of dynamics when playing, it is very musical and makes everybody he plays with sound better. I have to say that live this comes at a cost however. I have seen him live a few times where he has ruined the gig by not playing the room correctly. The drastic change in dynamics can become jarring and quite distracting in my experience. But on record and on dates where the room can support his style he is incredible however and few can compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the Fellowship records Landmarks has long been my favourite of the lot. I feel that at this point the band is so familiar with each other that they are completely free to express themselves. The record prior to this one are great and I still enjoy listening to them, but as a complete statement Landmarks is where they nail it. While taking a nod to jazz artists that come before them the Fellowship band really thrives at bringing in elements from Gospel and American Folk like lyricism. It is more about an overall atmopshere and feeling than it is technicality, each member adds texture upon texture to create a landscape. This is an album where it's best to just let it wash over you, and it may take a few listens to truly appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting tracks on an album like this is difficult as I feel it's best to listen from start to finish. At the start of this post I embedded the title track &quot;Landmarks&quot; which features a bass led folk-like motif as its main theme. There is a spiritual quality to the piece with it almost feeling like a hymn. The interplay between Blade and Walden is also a particular highlight. &quot;He Died Fighting&quot;  (embedded above) in contrast features a rootsy bluesy theme driven by Cowherd's piano followed by some gutsy blues influenced soloing. While the soloists clearly exhibit virtuosic ability that is not what is important here, the focus is always on the tune - the band is almost completely devoid of ego which is part of the magic.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UuKjBpYzsQk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The album closes with the shorter piece &quot;Embers&quot; (above) based around a country-like theme but featuring gospel-like sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Landmarks represents a truly original and fresh take on modern jazz. It takes influence from the past but is not beholden to it while not trying to be modern for the sake of it. The Fellowship Band have created a sonic universe that is all their own hopefully we will see many more releases from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are heading back to the fine folks at Plot Coffee Roasting ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://plotroasting.com/&quot;&gt;https://plotroasting.com/&lt;/a&gt; ) - now a near permanent fixture on the blog. Plot are consistently crushing it lately with great coffee after great coffee, definitely check them out if you have not already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we have a super interesting one, and possibly a first for me. The coffee is from a farm &quot;Finca la Senda&quot; located within the Acatenango region of Guatemala. In the past few years I've noticed the quality of Guatemalan coffee has increased exponentially, I've had some really special coffees from there. What makes this coffee particularly interesting is the &quot;yeast maceration&quot; processing method. Here Pache varietals are picked and the whole cherries are placed under carbonic maceration for 30 hours. Following this a specific strain of Champagne yeast is added to the mix and maceration continues for a further 36 hours, before being sun-dried for 30 days. This is a fairly long processing time which gives plenty of opportunity for complex flavours to develop. The introduction of a Champagne yeast is new to me - at least I can't remember trying a yeasted coffee before (but I try many so I may have simply forgtten).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's just get down to business. On the dry aroma I don't get a huge bouquet, it is fairly quiet and refined in its presentation. There are fruity notes most notably orange and some delicate floral type notes but they're subtle. As I've stated many times in the past a lack of &quot;punch&quot; here does not always translate into the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using my tried and tested filter recipe the first word that comes to mind for me is: Exceptional. This is an incredibly refined cup, I feel as though I should be sat in a tuxedo to do the coffee justice. The main flavour notes are oranges and citrus fruits. The mouthfeel is a little sticky and the slight floral hint gives the impression of elderflower or honeysuckle. What is really mindblowing however is the finish which is exactly like Champagne. You don't notice it initially but after the initial hit of flavour and particularly in the aftertaste you get that unmistakable Champagne drying quality and a really strong white grape punch. It is also super sensitive to temperature and it really evolves as the cup cools. I find it best on the cooler side of things as it allows the more delicate notes to pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto the espresso: this coffee is definitely on the lighter side roast-wise so I was expecting a bit of a battle to get the best out of it (especially with the delicate flavour profile) - but it was a joy to dial in. I found it next to impossible to get a bad shot out of it - the only caveat being the machine needs to be blinding hot, too cold and some sourness creeps in. In the end I decided on a 1:2.25 ratio, this seemed to better preseve a silky mouthfeel that is otherwise lost. Going longer didn't increase the sweetness for me. The flavour profile is similar to the filter and that Champagne finish becomes even more intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both filter and espresso this coffee was fantastic and one I'm going to sorely miss. It may only be February but I feel this is a contender for &quot;coffee of the year&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week I had intended to talk about a specific album, but on Thursday the jazz-world was shocked at news of the passing of Armando &quot;Chick&quot; Corea. So instead I thought I'd share my Chick stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/043-Chick-Corea/Chick-Corea.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &quot;legend&quot; gets thrown around quite a lot these days, but Chick is one of the few truly deserving of that title. His career started in the mid 1960s working with the likes of Stan Getz, Blue Mitchell and Herbie Mann. His &quot;big break&quot; however came when he joined the Miles Davis band and was instrumental in driving the &quot;fusion&quot; sound that Davis was chasing at the time. After the stint with Davis he started another fusion group: &quot;Return to Forever&quot; - one of the most successful fusion groups of all time. In addition to rock he brought inspiration from Latin-American music (something he also visited in solo album &quot;My Spanish Heart&quot;). He also formed the &quot;Chick Corea Elektric Band&quot; - a fusion supergroup with legions of fans and the offshoot &quot;Akoustic Band&quot; where they dropped the electric instruments in favour of acoustic instruments. Subsequent to this Chick spent a lot of his career doing more traditional projects until the formation of another fusion group &quot;Five Peace Band&quot; with John McLaughlin, Kenny Garrett, Christian McBride and Vinnie Colaiuta. Chick Corea is one of the few artists who can span any decade and any style - you can essentially pick up any one of his records and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was never fortunate enough to meet Chick personally, but over the past 10 years or so I have seen him live countless times in many different contexts. One of the things you notice walking out of a Chick Corea gig is his warmth towards everybody. I remember one instance where he was playing a solo gig and the venue staff were keeping the doors closed while he was playing, only letting people get to their seats between tunes. Chick addressed this and said: &quot;what's going on? This is not a classical recital, let people come in and out as they want&quot; - there are not many artists around who would express such a sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then of course there is his use of the audience as a &quot;piano&quot; - whereby he'd get different sections of the audience each to sing a different note to create a chord to accompany his playing. This is something that others have tried but it usually feels uncomfortable and gimmicky, with Chick's enthusiasm and humour it totally works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another time I saw him in a trio context with Christian McBride on bass and Brian Blade on drums. To date one of the best gigs I have ever seen. It came across that they didn't even have a set list they just decided what they were going to play on the spot and the mood take them wherever they wanted to go. I'm sure there was a setlist or at least a shortlist to choose from, but the carefree energy added to an already amazing show. During this one I remember distinctly them playing &quot;Work&quot; by Thelonious Monk. People often talk about Chick in terms of raw technique and crazy knowledge of harmony - but he more than anybody understands what Monk is all about. He managed to capture all of the nuance from Monk - the feel, time and even captured the mannerisms often getting up from the piano and walking around during others solos. It was truly a joy to behold.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

I also remember attending the Elektric band reunion concert where they played the entire first album. All the guys recognised that the 80s synth sounds are a bit dated now so they had some fun with it. Chick even broke out the keytar a few times in true 80s style. Even though the synth sounds are not particularly popular today looking past that some of the music on that album still stands the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also the duet concert I saw between Chick and Herbie Hancock a couple of years ago. Even in his 70s Chick was still sprightly and energetic. He played some really daring music that night and one of the things I remember clearly is just seeing Herbie with a grin from ear to ear the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In losing Chick we lost one of the few remaining artists from a golden era. A master, a genius, whatever superlative you wish to throw around Chick was all of those things. Right til the end he was still touring and playing some of the best jazz gigs you could ever see. He will be truly missed.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

RIP Chick.&lt;/p&gt;

On the blog this week we are looking at the second installment of my Kaffebox subscription. The previous months coffees were delayed significantly due to various issues and so the coffees featured in this post arrived only a few days after those - a much better result as I can review the coffee fresh as intended! As I'm writing this blog the next months Kaffebox arrived so I expect those to feature in the not too distant future also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The featured roaster this week is: Kafferäven Per Nordby. A Swedish roaster located in Gothenburg - another new one to me. The packaging is clean and monotone which suits my aesthetic. They have included brew recipes for both filter and espresso on the reverse of the packaging so I can only assume this is an omniroast coffee. You can read more about them at www.kafferaven.se&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the previous Kaffebox subscription I have 2 different 125g bags to play with. This time I decided to dedicate one to filter and one to espresso, I feel this is the best option as it gives me a few chances to dial in the espresso. If I tried to make espresso and filter with each coffee I wouldn't have many attempts to dial in and I feel that would be unfair. I decided which was which based on origin/taste notes that I prefer in one method over the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the &quot;filter&quot; coffee. It is a honey processed coffee from Costa Rica called Senel Campos. Honey Costa Ricans have long been a favourite of mine, early in my coffee journey I had one from Hasbean coffee roasters that blew my mind and is one of the reasons I went further down the coffee rabbit hole. This particular example is made up entirely of the Catuai varietal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the dry aroma I get 2 distinct notes: caramel and apple. While not an absolute monster in terms of sillage, it is strong and punchy. This is especially true when grinding where the caramel became very noticable. In the cup the flavour notes are much the same for me: caramel and apple. Imagine biting into a toffee apple made with a very sharp green apple, that is the best description of how this coffee behaves in filter. There is quite a lot of sweetness but also quite a lot of acidity that cuts through, in the aftertaste it comes through as a sharp citrus kind of quality. This keeps the aftertaste very clean which is something I always look for. There is just enough body in the coffee to hold the flavour notes together. But interestingly, and this is going to sound a bit nuts, I find the body is mostly present in the aftertaste. When you're drinking the coffee you don't really notice the body but it reveals itself afterwards. This is not a quality I've noticed before in a coffee but it is something I'll be on the lookout for as it's kind of neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;espresso&quot; coffee is called El Avion, it hails from Nicaragua. It is a washed Caturra varietal. I decided to go for this one for espresso due to the flavour notes mentioning chocolates and nuts which I find tend to come out better in espresso based drinks. I typically find honey processed coffees the easiest to dial in though so it was a bit of a toss up between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dry aroma of this coffee doesn't hit quite as hard as the Senel Campos. The main note I get is a hazelnut and not much else. It's important not to place too much emphasis on dry aroma because that doesn't necessarily translate to the cup. As mentioned before on the bag there are brew recipes, here they recommend a 1:2.5 ratio in 32-35s. I am not a fan of having brew recipes for espresso on the bag, there is such a wide variety of machines and grinders out there it kind of becomes meaningless. Throw in differences in water, ability of the barista and it's clear you should follow your senses instead of the bag. Further, typically the same &quot;recipe&quot; is printed for every coffee offered by a roaster - it is unlikely each coffee will yield best results with the same recipe. This is not a moan aimed at Kafferäven but the industry more widely - we need to get better at communicating these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto the espresso itself: I found this one very easy to dial in. I tried the bag recommendation initially and it was OK, but for me it had a little too much bitterness in the finish. I found the best results at around 1:2.2 in around 22-25s. Temperature wise it worked best at a medium temperature, this coffee seems very easy to extract and so very easily finds itself in over-extracted territory. When dialled in it makes great espresso. It has an unctuous body and mouthfeel like thick milkshake. The toasted hazelnut note comes to  the forefront but is paired with quite a delicate floral backdrop - it is something I only noticed when I really focussed on tasting. It is not a distracting complexity, just something that's there if you look at it. As with the filter, the coffee is super clean - with this one I found the aftertaste was very shortlived but intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 2 great coffees from Kaffebox. If I had to pick a &quot;winner&quot; (not that they're in competition) I would go for the Costa Rican as it's just more &quot;my&quot; sort of coffee. I favour the crisper acidic coffees most of all. You can't go wrong with either however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we're hanging out with John Scofield and his 1996 album &quot;Quiet&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/042-Quiet/Quiet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John needs no introduction, he is rightly considered one of the biggest names in jazz today. His gigs remain extremely popular and he can sell out large venues the world over at the drop of a hat. He started his career in the late '70s where he worked with names such as Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan, Charles Mingus, Billy Cobham, Dave Liebman, Joe Henderson and was with the Miles Davis band for many years (as well as many other interesting projects). Alongside this he released his first solo album in the late 70s before getting &quot;big&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s - success that carries over to the present day.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNFjPH7_CQo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

What set John Scofield apart in the early days was his ability to blend the &quot;rock&quot; distorted electric guitar sound in a jazz context. Others may have been a few years earlier in doing this, but most got the tone all wrong - sounding like a bad teenage cover band. Sco was one of the first to really nail the tone and he acted as the blueprint for many others that followed. For most of his career the main signal chain hasn't changed significantly: an Ibanez AR semi-hollow (similar to a 335) into a dirt pedal (typically a rat) into a Vox AC30. This allowed him to do the rocky numbers but also clean up and give a convincing clean jazz sound too. During the '80s like many he went down the processed chorus drenched sound but thankfully he didn't stick with that for too long. In the '90s he became known for being one of the first to blend jazz with electronic music and hip-hop (at least with commercial success). A true innovator and maverick in the jazz-world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album today, however, is &quot;Quiet&quot; - this is an oddball in the Scofield back catalogue because he plays acoustic guitars exclusively. As a result it gets overlooked, his bigger &quot;hits&quot; like &quot;A Go Go&quot; with MMW, &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;, &quot;Uberjam&quot; and so on get all the acolades. These albums are of course fantastic but I find &quot;Quiet&quot; one of the best examples of Sco's compositional ability. I hope he releases a few more acoustic albums in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really magical about John's playing is his rhythmic ability and feel. With many jazz artists you can &quot;cop&quot; their style relatively easily. I don't hear many who do the &quot;Sco&quot; thing well, you only need to hear a split second of him playing and you are 100% certain it is him. I have read a description that &quot;John knows so much music that it just seems to ooze out of him every time he plays&quot; - which I think is the perfect description (I can't remember who came up with this description but full credit goes to them).

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qB4d4myzYbs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Back to the album itself. In addition to featuring acoustic guitars it also features a larger ensemble cast with rich horn arrangements throughout. In addition to featuring regular band mates: Steve Swallow on the bass and Bill Stewart on the drums if also features a wider cast of (the legendary) Wayne Shorter and Randy Brecker. In total there are 12 musicians on show, this allows John to create really rich and interesting arrangements. I think it's safe to say that Wayne Shorter had a big impact on this release as some of the arrangments have a &quot;Shorter&quot; kind of feel to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This album is largely about the orchestration and feel so it's not really about iconic &quot;moments&quot; or individual tunes. Throughout this post I have added some choice tunes but really this is an album that is best enjoyed from start to finish, just set it playing and let the moods wash over you. If you're a Sco fan but haven't heard this one, or you're just intrigued by the concept it's well worth hunting down a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the particularly keen: Jazz Night In America broadcast a gig by John celebrating both &quot;Quiet&quot; and another album of his &quot;Loud Jazz&quot; (1987). It is broken into a &quot;Quiet&quot; section and a &quot;Loud&quot; section and is also worth a watch. A link to the gig on YouTube can be seen below:

&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week on the blog we are taking a trip back to Bath and Round Hill Roastery. These folks require no introduction having featured multiple times on the blog and are a firm favourite at JazzCoffeeStuff HQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we have a bit of an interesting coffee. It is from El Salvador and is called &quot;Las Cruces&quot; which is the name of the mill where the coffee is processed. As with most El Salvador coffees this is a Bourbon varietal, where things get interesting however is the processing. This coffee uses a &quot;honey anaerobic&quot; method. Cherries are picked and then dry fermented anaerobically for 72 hours, they are then pulped and allowed to dry on raised beds where they are turned fairly infrequently to allow the flavours to develop. They also produce a version of this coffee that is &quot;natural anaerobic&quot; where the cherries are not pulped before drying. In theory the honey anaerobic should produce a slighlty cleaner cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Salvador is an origin I tend to favour but I have never seen an anaerobic process used there so I was very interested in giving this one a go. As usual I opt for filter roast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving straight in: on the dry aroma I am greeted with warm baking type spices such as ginger, nutmeg and cinnanom. This is paired with a brown sugar sweetness and caramel sort of note and a slight nuttiness. On first impressions not the wild ride you'd typically expect from an anaerobic coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a filter I noticed a few things; firstly this coffee does not enjoy high brew temperatures. Usually I like to leave my kettle hot as I find that works best for the sort of coffees I go for. This translates through to the cup too where it really comes alive as it cools. On the palette I get get an initial hit of tropical fruit, the bag notes say this is banana but I've never had much success in finding these &quot;banana&quot; notes in coffees. This descriptor seems to have sprung up in the past year or so out of nowhere. For me I'd describe it as a mango or papaya, it is not a big punchy tropical fruit bomb but it is there. The brown sugar and hazlenut sort of note in the nose also shows itself after the initial tropical hit. In the finish there is a grape-like sharpness that lingers for quite a while. In terms of body I would describe this as a medium to high (for the sorts of coffee I usually drink), sweetness is medium and acidity is medium also. It is not the cleanest cup I've ever had but that is expected with an anaerobic, but neither is it too funky. I've enjoyed this as a filter, especially when I've let it cool down. Drinking it at a higher temperature causes the flavours to &quot;bunch up&quot; and it's hard to differentiate the notes - some may enjoy that visceral sensation but I prefer flavour definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coffee as a filter was a bit of a difficult one. There is not a large sweetspot on this coffee and it took a bit of work to dial in (the espresso roast version is likely easier). As with the filter it doesn't like getting too hot so I kept my machine temperature around the middle of the range. I ended up pulling a quick shot (~20s) but a typical ratio (1:2) for the best results. I wanted it shorter to emphasise the body of the coffee but going for a more traditional time (~30s) and things started to get a bit muddy, pulling quicker cleaned things up a bit. The flavour profile is essentially the same as in the filter, but the real gem is the thick unctuous mouthfeel. The baking spices on the nose really come out in the espresso as well as the brown sugar. It is almost like drinking cake batter. As with the filter there is a lingering sharp grape-like finish to the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall an interesting cup. A little different to the usual coffees I go for but very well done. I'd say this is more of a coffee for the curious than those wanting an easy day to day drinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side we're heading back to the late '90s with the Kenny Garrett classic: Songbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/041-Songbook/Songbook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a busy week at JazzCoffeeStuff HQ this week, in such circumstances I hunt out dependable albums that I know won't disappoint - it is not a time for finding new music. &quot;Songbook&quot; is an album I've listened to start to finish countless times over the years and it is an all time favourite of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny first made his way onto the scene in the mid 1980s, with his first solo album being released in 1984. He also joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in 1986 - a true badge of honour for any up and coming jazz musician. In these early days he was rooted in the post-bop or hard-bop camp. While the early recordings are a great introduction to the man, it wasn't until the early to mid-90s that Kenny really found his sound. Pretty much any Kenny Garrett album from the '90s is a classic and worth hunting down. My favourite, and likely his most successful, is &quot;Songbook&quot; from 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meteoric rise of Coltrane the tenor sax became &quot;the&quot; sax instrument of choice for improvisers. Despite Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker's unquestionable influence on jazz the alto sax has been pushed to the sidelines by the deeper registered tenor. Kenny Garrett is one of the few who really keeps the alto alive and well. The choice of instrument has clearly had an impact on his musicality too, while he has the Coltrane chops (and has released a tribute album to the man) Kenny often favours the chirpier more staccato style of playing to the fluid legato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really sets Kenny's playing apart from the crowd however is the influence of asian music. While he doesn't go fully down the rabbit-hole of microtones he clearly takes a lot of inspiration from east-Asia specifically. On Songbook these influences are there but in the later albums the Asian influences come to the forefront - listening to the albums in order you can really hear the progression of these ideas.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zalsg6KSzPc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Another part of the Garrett magic is his ability to craft really simple and catchy melodies and weave them into more complex jazz pieces. This is something that was a big part of jazz until perhaps the 1970s where complexity took over and the newer generation of players wanted to push the boundaries of technicality and harmony. During the '90s certain artists such as Kenny Garrett and Christian McBride tried tp buck this trend and used simple melodies as a tool within their music. This is probably most evident in his &quot;hit&quot; - &quot;Happy People&quot; that forms part of just about every setlist he plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to perhaps what I associate most with Kenny Garrett: his amazing live performances. I believe he is consistently one of the greatest live performers around today. I have seen him countless times and I can only remember one gig where he wasn't fantastic - on that occassion he was staring daggers at the sound guy so was clearly not happy with something. But even that &quot;less than perfect&quot; gig was still a great evening. If you get a chance his performances are well worth the price of admission and I try and catch him every time he is in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Songbook&quot; consists of 10 Garrett originals, perhaps the best known is &quot;Sing a Song of Song&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) that has become a mainstay of his setlists ever since. It is a relatively simple melody which adds to its lasting appeal, but it also forms a good &quot;blank canvas&quot; for improvisation since it is essentially just a modal piece. The album recording also features a killer Garrett solo that takes us just far enough outside to keep you on your toes but at the same time respects the tune. There are also the pieces &quot;Brother Hubbard&quot; and &quot;Ms Baja&quot; in a similar vein which have also become fan favourites and tunes he often revisits live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album is more than a &quot;one-trick-pony&quot; however, it also features some serious hard-bop chops. Perhaps the best example of this is the opening track &quot;2 Down &amp;amp; 1 Across&quot; (embedded above). Here Kenny channels his inner Coltrane and goes hell for leather and presents a masterclass in post-bop soloing. It is not just Garrett who deserves a shout-out here with pianist Kenny Kirkland, drummer Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts and bassist Nat Reeves providing not only the perfect rhythm section but soloing in their own right.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARRXiXynz3g&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

I've often said on this blog that one of the biggest tests for improvising jazz musicians is the ballad. It is often difficult to strike the balance between respecting the tune and keeping the music interesting. &quot;Songbook&quot; contains a number of great ballads. The most popular is likely to be &quot;Before it's Time to Say Goodbye&quot; - a tune Garrett penned for his former employer Miles Davis. However &quot;She Waits for the New Sun&quot; is the ballad that always sticks in my mind from this album. It captures a pensive and contemplative mood and evokes a feeling of shuffling round the New York backstreets in autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any jazz fan &quot;Songbook&quot; is essential listening, especially if you're accustomed to listening to the &quot;classics&quot; and rarely stray past the 1960s in your record collection. In around 60 minutes of music there is not one second of &quot;filler&quot; on this album and it's likely to be one you'll forver come back to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
