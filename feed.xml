&lt;/center&gt;

After a brief month hiatus the Plot Roasters ICON series subscription is back! Owing to Brexit related supply chain issues this coffee was due to be released in February but unfortunately got delayed until March. Let's see if good things do indeed come to those who wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder this is the 3rd installment of the ICON series by Plot Roasters. This series is a relatively expensive series of rare and exciting coffees, it's for those who love coffee and don't mind paying to get access to the rare lots. In this installment we have a Gesha varietal from Panama. In the past we've talked about the rise of the Gesha varietal in the mid 2000s - and those with a good memory will recall that a particular lot from a Panamanian farm was responsible for causing the &quot;boom&quot;. It is therefore always interesting to get hold of some Gesha from Panama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance the Gesha was grown by the Hartmann family - one of the leading names in coffee in Panama, and their coffees always command high prices and achieve enviable cupping scores. The Hartmann family has owned farmland in Panama since the early 1900s, it now consists of many different coffee growing plots. The coffee we're talking about today is from the &quot;Roscosa Montana&quot; plot which translates to &quot;Rocky Mountain&quot; which borders the Parque Nacional de La Amistad rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself has been naturally processed - dried on raised African beds for a full 25 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous ICON installments this arrives in 150g bags only. As a result I don't use it for espresso since after a couple of shots to dial in I'd be left with very little to enjoy at its best! So it's a filter only blog-post this week. I have been drinking a great espresso alongside this one but I'll feature it next time in a dedicated post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving nose first into the dry aroma: the first thing to note is it smells incredible. The main hit is from tropical fruits, notably papaya and mango. But along with that there are caramel notes and a good floral bouquet. You can tell this is a very complex coffee before even taking a sip. Although it's a natural process there is not a hint of funkiness however, it seems very clean for a natural coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving into the filter: this coffee is truly exquisite. The supply chain delays seem irrelevant on first sip - it is well worth the wait. The first wave of flavour that hits is the tropical fruit notes from the nose. Papaya and Mango are most prevalent but there is also a sharpness to it too, perhaps a passionfruit. But in the supporting cast I also noted down wild strawberries and I could even be argued into agreeing the sharpness has a raspberry quality. What is so interesting about this coffee however is that the floral notes stand up to these big tropical fruit notes - I get strong violet and lavendar vibes from this one. It is very very rare to find a coffee where the florals don't get overwhelmed by the bigger bolder flavours. This makes for a super interesting and complex cup. As the cup cools down the balance between the fruit and the floral changes, the cooler you go the more florals you pick up. This is a coffee that demands you to savour and watch the flavour profiles develop, drinking this in a temperature controlled ember mug would be an absolute travesty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again Plot have smashed it out of the park. Looking forward to see what is to come with future ICON releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side we're going to look at another icon: Wayne Shorter with his 1966 release &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/047-All-Seeing-Eye/All-Seeing-Eye.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Wayne Shorter is certainly one of the elder-statesmen of jazz. Nearing in on his 90th birthday he has a career spanning around 70 years. During that time we has released solo works, been a member of both Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (with whom he became the primary composer for the band) and Miles Davis' band - along with being a founding member of one of the greatest fusion groups of all time in Weather Report. &quot;Star studded career&quot; isn't nearly enough to describe what Shorter has achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very start of his career Shorter was seen as &quot;just another Coltrane tribute act&quot; - a label that (rather unfairly) was attributed to many tenor players of that era. As his career developed it was clear Wayne was anything but. Instead of relying on flashy, complicated, virtuosic playing (although he certainly had chops) - Shorter is now best known for his compositional voice. You can argue that he is one the greatest composers in all of jazz, if not all of music. His compostional style is focussed heavily on harmony, and using this to create a &quot;mood&quot;. A few albums before &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; he released perhaps his most famous album &quot;Speak No Evil&quot; where he explores the modal jazz style. Although his later works can't really be considered &quot;modal&quot; in the same way you can tell the modal style of creating a mood for a piece stuck with Shorter.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylc6_wPm6SA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; marks Wayne's 9th solo outing, and to date his most ambitious. From the get-go it is clear this is not your run of the mill bop record but something new entirely. It makes some nods from the avant-garde and free movements but the compositions are much more structured than is often the case in those styles. It is a highly ambitious record that still sounds daring today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening title track (embedded at the start of this post) sets the tone for the rest of the record. In interviews Wayne has stated the entire album is an attempt to depict the meaning of life, creation and the nature of god. The solos on the title track thus represent &quot;the machinery involved in the process of creation&quot; - with other tracks on the album showing similar levels of symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most &quot;traditional&quot; bop-sounding track on the album is &quot;Chaos&quot; (above) - living up to its name it's a chaotic fire-breathing sort of piece which allows the stellar cast to flex their chops. The supporting cast on the album features: Freddie Hubbard on trumpet/flugelhorn, Grachan Moncur III on trombone, James Spaulding on alto, Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass and Joe Chambers on drums (with a cameo from Wayne's brother Alan on one piece). This is an enviable line-up of talent and the quality shows throughout, although the music is highly daring and experimental it never feels out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; represents one of my favourite Wayne Shorter albums and it is well worth your time. It is likely music you'll have to put the effort in to appreciate however, and it commands your attention. But it is an album that will reward your effort so it's worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are welcoming a new coffee roaster to the blog: Brew Coffee Plus. Located in Streatham, South London - these guys have been on my radar for a while but I haven't got round to trying them. They tick a few boxes for things I typically look for in a roaster: a concise offering, focusing on quality over quantity. Plus their packaging is attractive but simple. You can read more about them on their website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://brewcoffeeplus.com/&quot;&gt;https://brewcoffeeplus.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I opted for one of their Colombian offerings - Villa Betvlia - a Caturra microlot that has been naturally processed. The farm is located in Huila, a &quot;hotspot&quot; for coffee within the country. The bag/website does not offer much in the way of back story behind this coffee, fitting with Brew Plus Coffee's minimalist aesthetic, so I don't really know much more about this coffee. So I guess we should just dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the nose the first thing that hits you is big juicy tropical fruits. It is not a really intense &quot;fruit bomb&quot; aroma but more like a very nice tropical fruit salad. Although the tropical fruits hint towards natural processing methods you do not get the boozy/funky natural notes you often get. I also notice a caramel note in the supporting cast. Very appetising. In terms of roast level we are in a light range, but it is not super light/nordic by any means - not quite medium-light but getting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving swiftly onto the filter: again the over-arching flavour notes are tropical fruits. I get mango and pineapple most of all - the sweeter end of the tropical fruit range. There is also the passion fruit type acidity to matters but primarily I would say this is on the sweeter end rather than the acidic end. If you imagine a tropical fruit salad covered in a sugar-syrup you wouldn't be far off. The body and mouthfeel are in the medium sort of range, it is not completely absent but neither is it a coffee you need to chew. The aftertaste is fairly intense and lingering. Temperature wise I find this coffee is fairly linear - it has the same character hotter or cooler so it's one you can drink at your leisure. Overall it is not hugely complex but is certainly very drinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an espresso this might be one of the easiest coffees to dial in I've experienced. It can take pretty much whatever I threw at it in terms of recipe. In the end I found that I liked a 1:2.1 ratio with a 7s pre-infuse followed with a 32-34s pull - on the temperature scale I'm medium-high. This is not normally how I like to pull shots as it can introduce some bitterness or astringency to the finish but this is a coffee that can take it. You're rewarded with a thicker more luxurious shot and more intensity compared to my more usual longer/quicker style of pull. Again the tropical fruit salad and sugary sweetness comes through in the espresso, the acidity is slightly more noticable in the espresso but it is still a sweet coffee first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall a very enjoyable coffee, hopefully a sign of things to come from this roaster and one I'm sure I'll be heading back to based on this showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our jazz record this week we are heading back to 1973 and guitarist George Benson with his release: &quot;Body Talk&quot; on CTI records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/046-Body-Talk/Body-Talk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are new to the world of jazz you might be surprised to see George Benson recommended on a jazz-blog. For many he will be synonymous with pop records such as &quot;Give Me The Night&quot; or his &quot;crooner&quot; image from his later works. It is easy to forget he has some serious jazz under his belt also. When he burst onto the scene in the 1960s he was considered a protege to Wes Montgomery in some respects. George's &quot;twin careers&quot; of jazz star and pop star came to a head a few years ago at a gig in London whereby he was unable to sing so played a set of instrumental jazz pieces and the (non-jazz) crowd booed him for not playing his &quot;hits&quot; - a rather embarrassing incident for the London live music scene and those involved should be ashamed.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HV1Tfj8qqtI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Body Talk&quot; is one of my favourite Benson albums. It marks a kind of &quot;cross-over&quot; period from the more straight ahead jazz he was playing before and the RnB and pop influenced music that came after. I wish he spent a bit more time exploring this soul-jazz kind of space as he was very good at it. On this album Benson entrusted James Brown alumni - saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis to write and arrange a few of the tunes. But it is clear that the James Brown DNA heavily influenced Benson at the time since all the tracks feature the strong grooves we associate with Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album also features some heavyweight jazz icons in the supporting cast: Jack DeJohnette taking control of the drumming duties - one of the most prolific jazz drummers of all time. Jack manages to introduce a slight swing to proceedings while keeping the muscular grooves driving forward, something that is not easy to do by any means. Alongside is Ron Carter on the acoustic bass (the album also features Gary King on electric bass). We've spoken about Ron in the blog before, as a bass player he is completely reliable and can throw his hand at anything - another jazz legend. On the electric piano we also have Harold Mabern. He is one of the underappreciated greats, a lot of his work has been as a sideman rather than a leader. I was fortunate enough to be able to meet him before he passed away - a great musician and a great person. I'll save my Harold story for another day when we can focus on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with &quot;Dance&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) and straight away gets into a deep groove. You can tell that Benson had an eye on making music you can move to here, it's almost impossible to not tap your foot along to the beat. However, it features an absolutely virtuousic guitar performance throughout. I consider Benson as one of the most naturally gifted guitar players of all time. There appears to be absolutely no filter between brain and guitar, it comes across as completely effortless. This is backed up by watching some of his incomprehensible guitar tuition videos - it is so natural he is completely unable to effectively explain what he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another track that is particularly interesting on the album is the third number: &quot;Plum&quot; (above). This really exemplifies the two worlds of jazz and RnB that Benson is trying to straddle. It starts off in a swinging jazz tune but eventually the horns and percussion come in, the groove hits and we're comfortably in foot-tapping mode again. This is not a jarring experience of slamming two styles together - the transition is seamless. Again Benson throws out some mindblowing guitar lines as all this is unfolding.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/li5IDW_H_6s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Perhaps the hardest hitting groove is the title track &quot;Body Talk&quot; (above). Here we have a piece that is part James Brown groove and part Latin jazz. It's 8 minutes of pure energy and intensity. While there is incredible musicianship on display, the main theme is itself catchy and something you'll likely be humming to yourself after hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Body Talk&quot; is a bit of an underappreciated jazz album, from his &quot;jazz&quot; period other Benson albums such as &quot;Beyond Blue Horizon&quot; often get more publicity - but for me &quot;Body Talk&quot; is where Benson hits his stride. If you do not know anything of George Benson's jazz career I'd strongly suggest giving it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we're heading back to Plot Coffee Roasting again. A few blog posts ago we featured the rather special Champagne yeast processed coffee from Finca La Senda in Guatemala - this time we feature another experimental processed coffee from the very same farm. As before the coffee is of the Pache varietal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is described as a &quot;hydro-natrual&quot; - the cherries are picked and dried in the sun for 4 days before being soaked in water overnight. This &quot;rehydrates&quot; the cherries which are then dried in the shade for another 28-30 days. The folks at Finca La Senda are certainly experimental and they should be commended for it. I think processing variation is likely to be the key to unlocking new flavour potential in coffee. Of course genetic diversity of coffee plants can lead to variation but this is a slow process driven by evolution (aside from the rare &quot;freak discovery&quot; of an unknown varietal) - processing is something that has a shorter feedback loop and so is a more commercially viable for the farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit however I'm not a fan of all the experimental processings I've had. In fact I have a rather low hit rate of enjoyment from them, I often find them unbalanced or just plain odd. Based on the Champagne yeast processed coffee I have high hopes for this one however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets just dive straight into the coffee itself. Like the Champagne yeast offering Plot have opted for a pretty light roast, maybe a hair darker than the Champagne yeast but I never compared them side by side. On the dry aroma it is clear this is a very different beast. The first thing that I notice is the red berry note - it also has a sort of bramble note too, it reminds me of a fruit picking farm. In the background there is just a hint of tropical fruit, but it is not your typical &quot;fruit bomb&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual we start with a filter brew: just as on the nose the primary thing I notice is the red berry flavours. The label lists blueberry and raspberry, which I don't disagree with. The tropical fruit flavours are also more prominent in the cup, mango being the predominant note. On the acidity scale this one comes in quite high but it is balanced with a lot of sweetness. It also has quite a big mouthfeel and body. Interestingly I find this coffee is better at higher cup temperatures, usually I find the flavours difficult to distinguish at the higher temperatures but this coffee keeps its clarity. At lower cup temperatures the acidity can take over a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto espresso: as you'd expect for a light roast the machine temp is set to maximum. For a ratio I found 1:2.5 works best but I prefered to pull a bit slower than usual at around 30-32s. This allowed more of the body to come through and added some intensity to the shot. I didn't find this added any bitterness at all and everything balanced nicely. The flavour profile was much the same as the filter brew: mangos and raspberries. Despite being a fairly acidic light roast it is surprisingly easy to drink as an espresso and one I have enjoyed. The only downside to the espresso compared to the filter is less of the complexity comes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall another great offering. For me the Champagne yeast version was more up my street, but I could easily see others having the opposite preference. Drinking two coffees from the same farm with different processings is always interesting as you can see what a huge difference there is in the cup. These coffees are night and day different, in a blind tasting I don't think I'd be able to identify they were from the same farm. Plot offer a third processing from Finca La Senda (carbonic maceration) but unfortunately at the time I couldn't justify getting all three since I already had too much coffee to be getting on with. If it's still available next time I do a Plot order I'll pick up a bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we're heading back to an all time classic from 1957. The seminal &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; from Dizzy Gillespie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/045-Sonny-Side-Up/Sonny-Side-Up.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dizzy has featured on the blog in the past as a co-headliner but this is his first showing in his own right. Dizzy of course needs no introduction - one of the forefathers of be-bop, he is one of the few jazz artists who became known outside of the jazz community. Potentially down to his look: often sporting a beret, horn-rimmed glasses and of course the puffed out cheeks when playing. Or possibly down to his jovial and light hearted personality. But, there is no doubting his musical pedigree.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rezdck_Roog&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

By 1957 be-bop had pretty much run its course, it had become fairly &quot;mainstream&quot; in jazz by then so just playing be-bop was not enough to gain recognition. Jazz artists were beginning to look at the new &quot;post-bop&quot; world and where they could make their mark. For somebody like Dizzy who was one of the originators this could present a problem, it is often easy for an artist to get stuck in their stylistic box and unable to adapt with the times. To combat this Dizzy apointed two tenor saxophonists to help him out: Sonny Stitt and Sonny Rollins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides just providing am easy pun for the album's title the tenor pair provided the necessary artistic direction for the album. Both Sonny's were clearly disciples of Gillespie's buddy Charlie Parker - but instead of simply copying Bird licks they each developed upon the Parker framework in different ways. Stitt was most directly compared to Parker, originally playing alto he was often labelled a &quot;Parker Clone&quot;. To combat this he made the switch to the tenor and developed a more forceful approach, however he still adopted the belly-fire of Parker and made use of the wild lines we associate with be-bop. In contrast Rollins adapted the Parker ethos in a different way, he made use of the be-bop framework but explored thematic and motif led ideas. You could argue it is more of an intellectual approach, often adopting more complex harmonic devices and crafting lines that fall further from typical be-bop. Hearing the two tenor-men back-to-back is part of the joy of this album. You could never mistake one for the other since their styles are so different (although I believe one version of the liner notes did just that, stating that a Rollins solo appears first or vice versa) Yet both players serve the music being played and neither sounds out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With three titans in Gillespie, Rollins and Stitt - it would be easy to overlook the rest of the band: Ray Bryant on piano, Tommy Bryant on bass and Charlie Persip on drums. While these guys may not be &quot;headline acts&quot; as the others they do add to the quality of the album - so many albums featuring &quot;heavyweights&quot; fall down with poor supporting casts. This is particularly true for an album such as &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; where you have two tenor players battling each other for supremacy, the rhythm section needs to be tight and stay out of their way and that is certainly achieved here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; is afterall however a Dizzy Gillespie album so it is worth exploring a little bit of his role. The album is itself essentially a &quot;live&quot; studio album, all tracks were recorded in one take in a &quot;cutting session&quot; style. Reportedly before the date Dizzy did his best to rile up the rivalry between the Sonny's - important work to get the best out of the band. This all came to a head in the stand out tenor-duel on the track &quot;Eternal Triangle&quot;. For me this is Dizzy Gillespie's true talent: getting the best out of people. I do not believe Charlie Parker would have been nearly as revered as he is today without Gillespie. Dizzy worked out a lot of the harmonic complexities of be-bop which allowed Parker (and to a lesser extent Monk) to flourish.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

Dizzy is of course no slouch on the trumpet either, this is particularly clear on his killer solo on &quot;After Hours&quot;. He manages to pull of an effortlessly cool and laidback blues led solo. Not something you instantly think of when you think of a Dizzy solo. Then of course you cannot ignore the trademark Gillespie humour and wit - on this album coming through in the opening track &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;. Here Gillespie completely reworks the standard both melodically and rhythmically to create a fresh take on a well-trodden classic. We also get to hear Dizzy stretch his vocal chords which is always intresting too. I can see many parallels between his vocal phrasing on this tune and the phrasing used in rap music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to this album is its brevity - clocking in at just over 30 minutes. It would have been great to have another cut or two on the album but it doesen't take away from the enjoyment. For the jazz historians and those interested in the progression of be-bop it is a very interesting recording, but it is also a great listen for those that just want to hear a great old-fashioned cutting session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This blog post marks a return to my KaffeBox subscription. This time it features a pair of coffees from Danish coffee roaster Clever Coffee. Not to be confused with the &quot;clever dripper&quot; brewer manufactured by a totally different company. I have to admit I'd never heard of Clever Coffee prior to receiving these coffees, part of the joy of a subscription service like KaffeBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging wise they opt for quite a minimalist aesthetic with plain white packages and green labels. For each coffee there is a different shade of green so I assume they might have other colours for other coffees. Overall I don't mind the presentation but it is not as eye-catching as some other packaging I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the previous KaffeBox offerings I received 2 bags of 125g each, I decide to dedicate one to filter and one to espresso so I have a chance to dial in and get the best out of them. This time I decided which coffee to use for each preparation completely at random - it was whichever I picked up first when brewing the first filter coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the filter side this week we have La Catarata - a red catuai varietal from Costa Rica. The processing method is described as &quot;black honey&quot; - I've covered honey processing in previous posts so won't retread old ground there. But the &quot;black&quot; designation is used to refer to the amount of fruit/mucilage left on the seed as part of the honey process. Very loosely: a white honey means that a lot of the cherry is removed (&quot;closer to a washed&quot;) and black honey means more cherry is left attached (&quot;closer to a natural&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to notice about this coffee is that it's certainly on the lighter end roast wise. On the dry aroma I get hints of caramel and honey along with a fig fruity note. It has a heft to the nose but it is not something you'll smell across a room when somebody opens the bag. In the cup the first thing to note is how balanced the cup is; acidity and sweetness are in perfect harmony. In terms of flavours I get apples and caramels most of all. You get the crisp sharpness of a green apple followed by the sweetness of the caramel. In terms of body I would describe this as a medium, given the roast level it has more body that you would expect. The aftertaste is very clean and fairly short lived. It is not the most complex coffee you'll ever drink and you don't really get anything in the way of progression as the cup cools. It is a very reliable no-nonsense sort of cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the espresso side we have Fazenda Samambaia - a Mundo Novo varietal from Brazil. What is interesting here is that it is an anaerobically processed coffee, I don't remember seeing many Brazilian coffees with this processing method. However, Brazil is not an origin I spend much time with typically. On opening the bag again I notice the light roast level and on the nose I get caramel notes but overall it is a pretty subtle affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of dialing this coffee in I have to admit it was a bit of a challenge (this is a light filter roast so that is not a complaint). This coffee is prone to getting a bit acidic so to combat that I had to set the machine to maximum temperature. Pulling the shot long helped with this also but the coffee has a great body that is sacrificed so I preferred to keep it more in the 1:2.5 range. When it's right it is fantastic and super interesting. I would describe the sensation as being like those traditional pineapple cube sweets - that sort of tropical fruit note combined with huge sweetness. I find that the mouthfeel starts off kind of thin but the body &quot;blooms&quot; and you're left satisfied. If you don't have it dialed in or your puck prep is not quite right you do end up with a &quot;battery acid&quot; shot however. This is one for somebody experienced at making espresso and doesn't mind a bit of work, but you will be rewarded for it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this weeks jazz we're jumping back to 2014 with Brian Blade and The Fellowship Band and their Landmarks recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/044-Landmarks/Landmarks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landmarks is the fourth release from The Fellowship Band having released their debut album in 1998. The heart of the band features Brian Blade on drums, Jon Cowherd on piano, Myron Walden on alto sax and bass clarinet, Melvin Butler on soprano and tenor sax and Chris Thomas on bass. They also feature the occassional &quot;guest&quot; spots notably in the guitarist spot - on this album we have Marvin Sewell and Jeff Parker who replace Kurt Rosenwinkel

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aEcLf-uoqAA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Drummer Brian Blade is of course the &quot;headline act&quot; for this band and, arguably, the most famous musician on the recording. He is perhaps best known as a sideman and particularly through being &quot;Wayne Shorter's drummer&quot; for many years. He has also been a long time member of the Chick Corea trio and has appeared alongside more modern greats such as Joshua Redman and Kenny Garrett, as well as appearing on Joni Mitchell records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian's drumming style is both interesting and distinctive. A big part of his vibe is his use of dynamics when playing, it is very musical and makes everybody he plays with sound better. I have to say that live this comes at a cost however. I have seen him live a few times where he has ruined the gig by not playing the room correctly. The drastic change in dynamics can become jarring and quite distracting in my experience. But on record and on dates where the room can support his style he is incredible however and few can compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the Fellowship records Landmarks has long been my favourite of the lot. I feel that at this point the band is so familiar with each other that they are completely free to express themselves. The record prior to this one are great and I still enjoy listening to them, but as a complete statement Landmarks is where they nail it. While taking a nod to jazz artists that come before them the Fellowship band really thrives at bringing in elements from Gospel and American Folk like lyricism. It is more about an overall atmopshere and feeling than it is technicality, each member adds texture upon texture to create a landscape. This is an album where it's best to just let it wash over you, and it may take a few listens to truly appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting tracks on an album like this is difficult as I feel it's best to listen from start to finish. At the start of this post I embedded the title track &quot;Landmarks&quot; which features a bass led folk-like motif as its main theme. There is a spiritual quality to the piece with it almost feeling like a hymn. The interplay between Blade and Walden is also a particular highlight. &quot;He Died Fighting&quot;  (embedded above) in contrast features a rootsy bluesy theme driven by Cowherd's piano followed by some gutsy blues influenced soloing. While the soloists clearly exhibit virtuosic ability that is not what is important here, the focus is always on the tune - the band is almost completely devoid of ego which is part of the magic.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UuKjBpYzsQk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The album closes with the shorter piece &quot;Embers&quot; (above) based around a country-like theme but featuring gospel-like sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Landmarks represents a truly original and fresh take on modern jazz. It takes influence from the past but is not beholden to it while not trying to be modern for the sake of it. The Fellowship Band have created a sonic universe that is all their own hopefully we will see many more releases from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are heading back to the fine folks at Plot Coffee Roasting ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://plotroasting.com/&quot;&gt;https://plotroasting.com/&lt;/a&gt; ) - now a near permanent fixture on the blog. Plot are consistently crushing it lately with great coffee after great coffee, definitely check them out if you have not already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we have a super interesting one, and possibly a first for me. The coffee is from a farm &quot;Finca la Senda&quot; located within the Acatenango region of Guatemala. In the past few years I've noticed the quality of Guatemalan coffee has increased exponentially, I've had some really special coffees from there. What makes this coffee particularly interesting is the &quot;yeast maceration&quot; processing method. Here Pache varietals are picked and the whole cherries are placed under carbonic maceration for 30 hours. Following this a specific strain of Champagne yeast is added to the mix and maceration continues for a further 36 hours, before being sun-dried for 30 days. This is a fairly long processing time which gives plenty of opportunity for complex flavours to develop. The introduction of a Champagne yeast is new to me - at least I can't remember trying a yeasted coffee before (but I try many so I may have simply forgtten).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's just get down to business. On the dry aroma I don't get a huge bouquet, it is fairly quiet and refined in its presentation. There are fruity notes most notably orange and some delicate floral type notes but they're subtle. As I've stated many times in the past a lack of &quot;punch&quot; here does not always translate into the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using my tried and tested filter recipe the first word that comes to mind for me is: Exceptional. This is an incredibly refined cup, I feel as though I should be sat in a tuxedo to do the coffee justice. The main flavour notes are oranges and citrus fruits. The mouthfeel is a little sticky and the slight floral hint gives the impression of elderflower or honeysuckle. What is really mindblowing however is the finish which is exactly like Champagne. You don't notice it initially but after the initial hit of flavour and particularly in the aftertaste you get that unmistakable Champagne drying quality and a really strong white grape punch. It is also super sensitive to temperature and it really evolves as the cup cools. I find it best on the cooler side of things as it allows the more delicate notes to pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto the espresso: this coffee is definitely on the lighter side roast-wise so I was expecting a bit of a battle to get the best out of it (especially with the delicate flavour profile) - but it was a joy to dial in. I found it next to impossible to get a bad shot out of it - the only caveat being the machine needs to be blinding hot, too cold and some sourness creeps in. In the end I decided on a 1:2.25 ratio, this seemed to better preseve a silky mouthfeel that is otherwise lost. Going longer didn't increase the sweetness for me. The flavour profile is similar to the filter and that Champagne finish becomes even more intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both filter and espresso this coffee was fantastic and one I'm going to sorely miss. It may only be February but I feel this is a contender for &quot;coffee of the year&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week I had intended to talk about a specific album, but on Thursday the jazz-world was shocked at news of the passing of Armando &quot;Chick&quot; Corea. So instead I thought I'd share my Chick stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/043-Chick-Corea/Chick-Corea.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &quot;legend&quot; gets thrown around quite a lot these days, but Chick is one of the few truly deserving of that title. His career started in the mid 1960s working with the likes of Stan Getz, Blue Mitchell and Herbie Mann. His &quot;big break&quot; however came when he joined the Miles Davis band and was instrumental in driving the &quot;fusion&quot; sound that Davis was chasing at the time. After the stint with Davis he started another fusion group: &quot;Return to Forever&quot; - one of the most successful fusion groups of all time. In addition to rock he brought inspiration from Latin-American music (something he also visited in solo album &quot;My Spanish Heart&quot;). He also formed the &quot;Chick Corea Elektric Band&quot; - a fusion supergroup with legions of fans and the offshoot &quot;Akoustic Band&quot; where they dropped the electric instruments in favour of acoustic instruments. Subsequent to this Chick spent a lot of his career doing more traditional projects until the formation of another fusion group &quot;Five Peace Band&quot; with John McLaughlin, Kenny Garrett, Christian McBride and Vinnie Colaiuta. Chick Corea is one of the few artists who can span any decade and any style - you can essentially pick up any one of his records and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was never fortunate enough to meet Chick personally, but over the past 10 years or so I have seen him live countless times in many different contexts. One of the things you notice walking out of a Chick Corea gig is his warmth towards everybody. I remember one instance where he was playing a solo gig and the venue staff were keeping the doors closed while he was playing, only letting people get to their seats between tunes. Chick addressed this and said: &quot;what's going on? This is not a classical recital, let people come in and out as they want&quot; - there are not many artists around who would express such a sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then of course there is his use of the audience as a &quot;piano&quot; - whereby he'd get different sections of the audience each to sing a different note to create a chord to accompany his playing. This is something that others have tried but it usually feels uncomfortable and gimmicky, with Chick's enthusiasm and humour it totally works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another time I saw him in a trio context with Christian McBride on bass and Brian Blade on drums. To date one of the best gigs I have ever seen. It came across that they didn't even have a set list they just decided what they were going to play on the spot and the mood take them wherever they wanted to go. I'm sure there was a setlist or at least a shortlist to choose from, but the carefree energy added to an already amazing show. During this one I remember distinctly them playing &quot;Work&quot; by Thelonious Monk. People often talk about Chick in terms of raw technique and crazy knowledge of harmony - but he more than anybody understands what Monk is all about. He managed to capture all of the nuance from Monk - the feel, time and even captured the mannerisms often getting up from the piano and walking around during others solos. It was truly a joy to behold.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

I also remember attending the Elektric band reunion concert where they played the entire first album. All the guys recognised that the 80s synth sounds are a bit dated now so they had some fun with it. Chick even broke out the keytar a few times in true 80s style. Even though the synth sounds are not particularly popular today looking past that some of the music on that album still stands the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also the duet concert I saw between Chick and Herbie Hancock a couple of years ago. Even in his 70s Chick was still sprightly and energetic. He played some really daring music that night and one of the things I remember clearly is just seeing Herbie with a grin from ear to ear the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In losing Chick we lost one of the few remaining artists from a golden era. A master, a genius, whatever superlative you wish to throw around Chick was all of those things. Right til the end he was still touring and playing some of the best jazz gigs you could ever see. He will be truly missed.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

RIP Chick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

On the blog this week we are looking at the second installment of my Kaffebox subscription. The previous months coffees were delayed significantly due to various issues and so the coffees featured in this post arrived only a few days after those - a much better result as I can review the coffee fresh as intended! As I'm writing this blog the next months Kaffebox arrived so I expect those to feature in the not too distant future also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The featured roaster this week is: Kafferäven Per Nordby. A Swedish roaster located in Gothenburg - another new one to me. The packaging is clean and monotone which suits my aesthetic. They have included brew recipes for both filter and espresso on the reverse of the packaging so I can only assume this is an omniroast coffee. You can read more about them at www.kafferaven.se&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the previous Kaffebox subscription I have 2 different 125g bags to play with. This time I decided to dedicate one to filter and one to espresso, I feel this is the best option as it gives me a few chances to dial in the espresso. If I tried to make espresso and filter with each coffee I wouldn't have many attempts to dial in and I feel that would be unfair. I decided which was which based on origin/taste notes that I prefer in one method over the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the &quot;filter&quot; coffee. It is a honey processed coffee from Costa Rica called Senel Campos. Honey Costa Ricans have long been a favourite of mine, early in my coffee journey I had one from Hasbean coffee roasters that blew my mind and is one of the reasons I went further down the coffee rabbit hole. This particular example is made up entirely of the Catuai varietal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the dry aroma I get 2 distinct notes: caramel and apple. While not an absolute monster in terms of sillage, it is strong and punchy. This is especially true when grinding where the caramel became very noticable. In the cup the flavour notes are much the same for me: caramel and apple. Imagine biting into a toffee apple made with a very sharp green apple, that is the best description of how this coffee behaves in filter. There is quite a lot of sweetness but also quite a lot of acidity that cuts through, in the aftertaste it comes through as a sharp citrus kind of quality. This keeps the aftertaste very clean which is something I always look for. There is just enough body in the coffee to hold the flavour notes together. But interestingly, and this is going to sound a bit nuts, I find the body is mostly present in the aftertaste. When you're drinking the coffee you don't really notice the body but it reveals itself afterwards. This is not a quality I've noticed before in a coffee but it is something I'll be on the lookout for as it's kind of neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;espresso&quot; coffee is called El Avion, it hails from Nicaragua. It is a washed Caturra varietal. I decided to go for this one for espresso due to the flavour notes mentioning chocolates and nuts which I find tend to come out better in espresso based drinks. I typically find honey processed coffees the easiest to dial in though so it was a bit of a toss up between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dry aroma of this coffee doesn't hit quite as hard as the Senel Campos. The main note I get is a hazelnut and not much else. It's important not to place too much emphasis on dry aroma because that doesn't necessarily translate to the cup. As mentioned before on the bag there are brew recipes, here they recommend a 1:2.5 ratio in 32-35s. I am not a fan of having brew recipes for espresso on the bag, there is such a wide variety of machines and grinders out there it kind of becomes meaningless. Throw in differences in water, ability of the barista and it's clear you should follow your senses instead of the bag. Further, typically the same &quot;recipe&quot; is printed for every coffee offered by a roaster - it is unlikely each coffee will yield best results with the same recipe. This is not a moan aimed at Kafferäven but the industry more widely - we need to get better at communicating these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto the espresso itself: I found this one very easy to dial in. I tried the bag recommendation initially and it was OK, but for me it had a little too much bitterness in the finish. I found the best results at around 1:2.2 in around 22-25s. Temperature wise it worked best at a medium temperature, this coffee seems very easy to extract and so very easily finds itself in over-extracted territory. When dialled in it makes great espresso. It has an unctuous body and mouthfeel like thick milkshake. The toasted hazelnut note comes to  the forefront but is paired with quite a delicate floral backdrop - it is something I only noticed when I really focussed on tasting. It is not a distracting complexity, just something that's there if you look at it. As with the filter, the coffee is super clean - with this one I found the aftertaste was very shortlived but intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 2 great coffees from Kaffebox. If I had to pick a &quot;winner&quot; (not that they're in competition) I would go for the Costa Rican as it's just more &quot;my&quot; sort of coffee. I favour the crisper acidic coffees most of all. You can't go wrong with either however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we're hanging out with John Scofield and his 1996 album &quot;Quiet&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/042-Quiet/Quiet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John needs no introduction, he is rightly considered one of the biggest names in jazz today. His gigs remain extremely popular and he can sell out large venues the world over at the drop of a hat. He started his career in the late '70s where he worked with names such as Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan, Charles Mingus, Billy Cobham, Dave Liebman, Joe Henderson and was with the Miles Davis band for many years (as well as many other interesting projects). Alongside this he released his first solo album in the late 70s before getting &quot;big&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s - success that carries over to the present day.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNFjPH7_CQo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

What set John Scofield apart in the early days was his ability to blend the &quot;rock&quot; distorted electric guitar sound in a jazz context. Others may have been a few years earlier in doing this, but most got the tone all wrong - sounding like a bad teenage cover band. Sco was one of the first to really nail the tone and he acted as the blueprint for many others that followed. For most of his career the main signal chain hasn't changed significantly: an Ibanez AR semi-hollow (similar to a 335) into a dirt pedal (typically a rat) into a Vox AC30. This allowed him to do the rocky numbers but also clean up and give a convincing clean jazz sound too. During the '80s like many he went down the processed chorus drenched sound but thankfully he didn't stick with that for too long. In the '90s he became known for being one of the first to blend jazz with electronic music and hip-hop (at least with commercial success). A true innovator and maverick in the jazz-world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album today, however, is &quot;Quiet&quot; - this is an oddball in the Scofield back catalogue because he plays acoustic guitars exclusively. As a result it gets overlooked, his bigger &quot;hits&quot; like &quot;A Go Go&quot; with MMW, &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;, &quot;Uberjam&quot; and so on get all the acolades. These albums are of course fantastic but I find &quot;Quiet&quot; one of the best examples of Sco's compositional ability. I hope he releases a few more acoustic albums in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really magical about John's playing is his rhythmic ability and feel. With many jazz artists you can &quot;cop&quot; their style relatively easily. I don't hear many who do the &quot;Sco&quot; thing well, you only need to hear a split second of him playing and you are 100% certain it is him. I have read a description that &quot;John knows so much music that it just seems to ooze out of him every time he plays&quot; - which I think is the perfect description (I can't remember who came up with this description but full credit goes to them).

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qB4d4myzYbs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Back to the album itself. In addition to featuring acoustic guitars it also features a larger ensemble cast with rich horn arrangements throughout. In addition to featuring regular band mates: Steve Swallow on the bass and Bill Stewart on the drums if also features a wider cast of (the legendary) Wayne Shorter and Randy Brecker. In total there are 12 musicians on show, this allows John to create really rich and interesting arrangements. I think it's safe to say that Wayne Shorter had a big impact on this release as some of the arrangments have a &quot;Shorter&quot; kind of feel to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This album is largely about the orchestration and feel so it's not really about iconic &quot;moments&quot; or individual tunes. Throughout this post I have added some choice tunes but really this is an album that is best enjoyed from start to finish, just set it playing and let the moods wash over you. If you're a Sco fan but haven't heard this one, or you're just intrigued by the concept it's well worth hunting down a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the particularly keen: Jazz Night In America broadcast a gig by John celebrating both &quot;Quiet&quot; and another album of his &quot;Loud Jazz&quot; (1987). It is broken into a &quot;Quiet&quot; section and a &quot;Loud&quot; section and is also worth a watch. A link to the gig on YouTube can be seen below:

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week on the blog we are taking a trip back to Bath and Round Hill Roastery. These folks require no introduction having featured multiple times on the blog and are a firm favourite at JazzCoffeeStuff HQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we have a bit of an interesting coffee. It is from El Salvador and is called &quot;Las Cruces&quot; which is the name of the mill where the coffee is processed. As with most El Salvador coffees this is a Bourbon varietal, where things get interesting however is the processing. This coffee uses a &quot;honey anaerobic&quot; method. Cherries are picked and then dry fermented anaerobically for 72 hours, they are then pulped and allowed to dry on raised beds where they are turned fairly infrequently to allow the flavours to develop. They also produce a version of this coffee that is &quot;natural anaerobic&quot; where the cherries are not pulped before drying. In theory the honey anaerobic should produce a slighlty cleaner cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Salvador is an origin I tend to favour but I have never seen an anaerobic process used there so I was very interested in giving this one a go. As usual I opt for filter roast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving straight in: on the dry aroma I am greeted with warm baking type spices such as ginger, nutmeg and cinnanom. This is paired with a brown sugar sweetness and caramel sort of note and a slight nuttiness. On first impressions not the wild ride you'd typically expect from an anaerobic coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a filter I noticed a few things; firstly this coffee does not enjoy high brew temperatures. Usually I like to leave my kettle hot as I find that works best for the sort of coffees I go for. This translates through to the cup too where it really comes alive as it cools. On the palette I get get an initial hit of tropical fruit, the bag notes say this is banana but I've never had much success in finding these &quot;banana&quot; notes in coffees. This descriptor seems to have sprung up in the past year or so out of nowhere. For me I'd describe it as a mango or papaya, it is not a big punchy tropical fruit bomb but it is there. The brown sugar and hazlenut sort of note in the nose also shows itself after the initial tropical hit. In the finish there is a grape-like sharpness that lingers for quite a while. In terms of body I would describe this as a medium to high (for the sorts of coffee I usually drink), sweetness is medium and acidity is medium also. It is not the cleanest cup I've ever had but that is expected with an anaerobic, but neither is it too funky. I've enjoyed this as a filter, especially when I've let it cool down. Drinking it at a higher temperature causes the flavours to &quot;bunch up&quot; and it's hard to differentiate the notes - some may enjoy that visceral sensation but I prefer flavour definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coffee as a filter was a bit of a difficult one. There is not a large sweetspot on this coffee and it took a bit of work to dial in (the espresso roast version is likely easier). As with the filter it doesn't like getting too hot so I kept my machine temperature around the middle of the range. I ended up pulling a quick shot (~20s) but a typical ratio (1:2) for the best results. I wanted it shorter to emphasise the body of the coffee but going for a more traditional time (~30s) and things started to get a bit muddy, pulling quicker cleaned things up a bit. The flavour profile is essentially the same as in the filter, but the real gem is the thick unctuous mouthfeel. The baking spices on the nose really come out in the espresso as well as the brown sugar. It is almost like drinking cake batter. As with the filter there is a lingering sharp grape-like finish to the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall an interesting cup. A little different to the usual coffees I go for but very well done. I'd say this is more of a coffee for the curious than those wanting an easy day to day drinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side we're heading back to the late '90s with the Kenny Garrett classic: Songbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/041-Songbook/Songbook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a busy week at JazzCoffeeStuff HQ this week, in such circumstances I hunt out dependable albums that I know won't disappoint - it is not a time for finding new music. &quot;Songbook&quot; is an album I've listened to start to finish countless times over the years and it is an all time favourite of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny first made his way onto the scene in the mid 1980s, with his first solo album being released in 1984. He also joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in 1986 - a true badge of honour for any up and coming jazz musician. In these early days he was rooted in the post-bop or hard-bop camp. While the early recordings are a great introduction to the man, it wasn't until the early to mid-90s that Kenny really found his sound. Pretty much any Kenny Garrett album from the '90s is a classic and worth hunting down. My favourite, and likely his most successful, is &quot;Songbook&quot; from 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meteoric rise of Coltrane the tenor sax became &quot;the&quot; sax instrument of choice for improvisers. Despite Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker's unquestionable influence on jazz the alto sax has been pushed to the sidelines by the deeper registered tenor. Kenny Garrett is one of the few who really keeps the alto alive and well. The choice of instrument has clearly had an impact on his musicality too, while he has the Coltrane chops (and has released a tribute album to the man) Kenny often favours the chirpier more staccato style of playing to the fluid legato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really sets Kenny's playing apart from the crowd however is the influence of asian music. While he doesn't go fully down the rabbit-hole of microtones he clearly takes a lot of inspiration from east-Asia specifically. On Songbook these influences are there but in the later albums the Asian influences come to the forefront - listening to the albums in order you can really hear the progression of these ideas.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zalsg6KSzPc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Another part of the Garrett magic is his ability to craft really simple and catchy melodies and weave them into more complex jazz pieces. This is something that was a big part of jazz until perhaps the 1970s where complexity took over and the newer generation of players wanted to push the boundaries of technicality and harmony. During the '90s certain artists such as Kenny Garrett and Christian McBride tried tp buck this trend and used simple melodies as a tool within their music. This is probably most evident in his &quot;hit&quot; - &quot;Happy People&quot; that forms part of just about every setlist he plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to perhaps what I associate most with Kenny Garrett: his amazing live performances. I believe he is consistently one of the greatest live performers around today. I have seen him countless times and I can only remember one gig where he wasn't fantastic - on that occassion he was staring daggers at the sound guy so was clearly not happy with something. But even that &quot;less than perfect&quot; gig was still a great evening. If you get a chance his performances are well worth the price of admission and I try and catch him every time he is in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Songbook&quot; consists of 10 Garrett originals, perhaps the best known is &quot;Sing a Song of Song&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) that has become a mainstay of his setlists ever since. It is a relatively simple melody which adds to its lasting appeal, but it also forms a good &quot;blank canvas&quot; for improvisation since it is essentially just a modal piece. The album recording also features a killer Garrett solo that takes us just far enough outside to keep you on your toes but at the same time respects the tune. There are also the pieces &quot;Brother Hubbard&quot; and &quot;Ms Baja&quot; in a similar vein which have also become fan favourites and tunes he often revisits live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album is more than a &quot;one-trick-pony&quot; however, it also features some serious hard-bop chops. Perhaps the best example of this is the opening track &quot;2 Down &amp;amp; 1 Across&quot; (embedded above). Here Kenny channels his inner Coltrane and goes hell for leather and presents a masterclass in post-bop soloing. It is not just Garrett who deserves a shout-out here with pianist Kenny Kirkland, drummer Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts and bassist Nat Reeves providing not only the perfect rhythm section but soloing in their own right.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARRXiXynz3g&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

I've often said on this blog that one of the biggest tests for improvising jazz musicians is the ballad. It is often difficult to strike the balance between respecting the tune and keeping the music interesting. &quot;Songbook&quot; contains a number of great ballads. The most popular is likely to be &quot;Before it's Time to Say Goodbye&quot; - a tune Garrett penned for his former employer Miles Davis. However &quot;She Waits for the New Sun&quot; is the ballad that always sticks in my mind from this album. It captures a pensive and contemplative mood and evokes a feeling of shuffling round the New York backstreets in autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any jazz fan &quot;Songbook&quot; is essential listening, especially if you're accustomed to listening to the &quot;classics&quot; and rarely stray past the 1960s in your record collection. In around 60 minutes of music there is not one second of &quot;filler&quot; on this album and it's likely to be one you'll forver come back to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week on the blog we make use of my brand new KaffeBox subscription. For those that do not know KaffeBox are based in Norway and do a subscription service sourcing coffees from the best roasters in Scandanavia. You can read more about them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaffebox.no/scandinavian-nordic-roast-coffee-subscription/&quot;&gt;here!&lt;/a&gt; Unfortunately due to the christmas period, Covid lockdowns and Brexit delays these coffees arrived to me a little late (roast date 26th November) - so I'm taking this in mind in this review. While the 8 or so weeks is not very old for a coffee (especially for a light filter roast) the flavours might pop a little more if I'd had them a little earlier. And to be perfectly clear, this is not KaffeBox's fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee themselves is from a roaster in Lund, Sweden called &quot;Love Coffee&quot;. This roaster is completely new to me, I have never tried their coffee before (at least I can't remember if I have). The first thing that strikes me is the packaging, which is very nice. The bag features a black and white cartoon of a coffee shop on the front and a roaster on the back. It's always nice to see roasters put some effort into their packaging designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/040-State-of-the-Tenor/Love-Coffee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case I recieved 2 smaller 125g bags of coffee: one being a washed Colombian 'La Esperanza' and a natural Ethiopian 'Buku'. These are very &quot;classic&quot; origins and processing methods so a good introduction to a new roaster. I used both of these coffees as espresso exclusively (as I was using last week's Plot ICON as my filter alongside them) - so filter fans will need to wait until next week for their fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the Colombian La Esperanza. The farm is located in Nariño, Colobmbia - a location I'm not overly familiar with. It is a washed coffee that is made up of at least 70% of the &quot;yellow Colombia&quot; varietal - as the name suggests a yellow cherry fruit. I can't really find much more information on this one so let's dive straight into the espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case on this blog we are making espresso with &quot;filter&quot; roasts which tend to be quite light. This can often make the dialing in process fiddly. However, in this case it was very easy. The coffee was extremely forgiving with my setup. I found that it actually liked to be around a 1:2 ratio with a fairly ordinary recipe. This accentuates the natural body and mouthfeel in this coffee and is more pleasant to drink. In the flavour notes I got a very nutty quality underlying some top notes of a sweet red apple. The sweetness is fairly high and the acidity muted in this one. This is the sort of coffee that is a pleasure to drink, you don't have to think about it too muich and it just leaves you satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we have the Ethiopian Buku. This coffee takes its name from the washing station where the coffee was processed. The station is located in the Guji zone in the southern part of the country - an area very familiar to those who have read some of my previous postings. The varietals are listed as &quot;heirloom&quot; which is something we have covered in the past so I will not re-tread old ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was not quite as easy to dial in as the Colombian, but it was not particularly difficult either. Pulling the shots too short introduced a bit of harshness in the finish so I pulled slightly longer to around 1:2.25 in the end. There is plenty of natural sweetness and the acidity is not too high so there was not a huge benefit in pulling any longer than this. This coffee absolutely loves high temperatures though and I had to set my machine to its hottest setting for optimal results. This results in an intensely perfumed cup, I get strong notes of lavendar and bergamot first and foremost. This is combined with the &quot;bruised blueberry&quot; note you often get with a natural Guji. On the funk-o-meter it is fairly low however, it is refined and fairly clean tasting. There is some body in the cup but it is not a &quot;huge&quot; coffee. I found this coffee really enjoyable, these highly perfumed coffees are my favourite ones to use as an espresso so this one was a lot of fun, I wish I had a bit more of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall a strong showing from Love Coffee, a roaster I'll certainly keep an eye out for in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week I have been listening to the live double album from Joe Henderson: &quot;State of the Tenor&quot; recorded at the Village Vanguard in 1985 and released in 1986 on Blue Note Records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/040-State-of-the-Tenor/State-of-the-Tenor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally this album was released as 2 seperate LPs: &quot;State of the Tenor Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;State of the Tenor Vol. 2&quot; - but subsequently were combined into a double LP. There are so many stellar tunes on this album perhaps I could have seperated them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid 80s jazz was in a bit of a funny place. At this point fusion was really the &quot;hip&quot; thing to be playing (although that trend in itself was coming to an end) and playing more straight ahead was considered a bit dull and boring. I consider &quot;State of the Tenor&quot; to be Joe throwing down the gauntlet and showing just how creative you can be with a basic acoustic trio of: tenor, bass and drums. The original liner notes to the album states that the recorded concerts were effectivly &quot;saxaphone lessons&quot; owing to the sheer number of sax players in attendence.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4sA09U-8Og&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

I am a huge Joe Henderson fan, I make no apologies about this. He features regularly on this blog as a result. For me he is, perhaps, the greatest improviser of all time. Some players can play flashier more complicated lines and others may play with a bigger rounder sax sound but Joe captures &quot;something&quot; when he's improvising. In terms of lineage he is clearly in the Sonny Rollins school first and foremost, their playing is quite similar in many regards (even the trio format on this album is something you could link back to Rollins). But Joe takes it a step further, he will stray further &quot;outside&quot; than Rollins ever will. Not only will he play outside harmony we will stray outside in his timing also. His &quot;natural&quot; rhythmic device is to lead the band, it almost feels as if he is pulling the other band members along at times. For effect he'll also play really loose and instinctively, the timing of his lines doesn't &quot;fit&quot; in the true sense but it works because of the overall mood he manages to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then of course we have Henderson's virtuosity. John Coltrane is often a name synonymous with tenor virtuosity, he plays incredibly fast and harmonically complicated lines (at least before his modal/spiritual journey). These lines all fall relatively comfortably under the fingers however, it still requires immense practice to play that way but the lines usually feel &quot;comfortable&quot;. In contrast some of the lines Joe plays are hideous under the fingers, for anybody but Joe they feel wrong and unintuitive. He might not (often) reach Coltrane's break neck speeds but I argue these lines are way more difficult to play, especially the way Joe does with the odd note groupings and accents. You sometimes here others try and play &quot;Henderson licks&quot; but they are never that convincing nor sound as fluid as Joe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album itself features a combination of Henderson originals and standards by the likes of Parker, Silver, Mingus and Ellington. The album opens with &quot;Beatrice&quot; penned by Sam Rivers (embedded at the start of this post). Continuing the theme of &quot;jazz education&quot; I've always felt that this take was a heavy influence on some of the current crop of tenor players; most notably JD Allen - on many of his albums I notice bass/sax interplay that always makes me think of this take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting the rest of the cast on this album. On the bass we have Ron Carter - even trying to summarise his recorded output would take up multiple blog posts. Not much more needs to be said about Ron, definitely a legend and one of the greatest bass players in the history of jazz. Rounding out the line-up is Al Foster on drums - again somebody who has played with just about anybody you care to mention. Overall an absolutely incredible line-up for a trio format, it would have been great to hear this band live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second track I picked for this post is &quot;Boo Boo's Birthday&quot; - a piece penned by Thelonious Monk (embedded above). Thelonious is clearly a big influence for Joe, his sense of timing can certainly be described as &quot;Monk-like&quot;. Of course, he also has the tune &quot;Isotope&quot; (originally on &quot;Inner Urge&quot; but a version also appears on this album) which he describes as a tribute to Monk. I find Monk tunes a great canvas for improvisers, the tunes are often very playful which helps the musicians relax. Jazz improvisation is often seen as very &quot;serious&quot; so it's nice to hear musicians having fun from time to time. Of course Monk's arrangements also tend to be quite spacious which allows for more experimentation.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

The last tune I want to highlight from this album (although they're all stellar) is the Henderson penned: &quot;Y Ya La Quiero&quot; (above). Continuing the theme of education and influence: to me it is clear to see how this influence Kenny Garrett in quite a profound way. When this was recorded Kenny would have just been starting his career and had not quite yet found his signature sound. His early to mid 90s sound is very reminiscent of this &quot;Y Ya La Quiero&quot; and I am always reminded of Kenny when this tune plays. As a Henderson tune it is a bit of an outlier, it is not what you would consider a &quot;typical&quot; arrangement for him which makes it quite a nice addition to this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most albums on this blog you really cannot go wrong with this one. My only slight complaint is that on some releases of this album the sound is all over the show, some tunes quiet some tunes really loud. I don't know exactly which releases are the ones to avoid (the &quot;bad&quot; version I had was on a CD) but it's worth keeping in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are back looking at a very special coffee. Last month you may have remembered the Yemeni coffee from Plot Coffee Roasting - this was the first in a new coffee &quot;series&quot; called &quot;Icon&quot; offered by Plot. The idea being that the coffees offered represent the &quot;best of the best&quot; and some of the rarest coffees available. This week we have the second offering in this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the coffeee comers courtesy of Finca Monteblanco in Huila, Colombia. Huila is a relatively small department within Colombia located in the south-west region of the country. As a coffee producer Huila certainly punches above its weight however and you don't have to search very hard to find specialty coffee from the region. The farm is owned by Rodrigo Sanchez Valencia who inherited the farm from his grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main areas of interest with this coffee: firstly the varietal is our old friend Gesha. The gesha varietal has appeared on the blog multiple times, it is currently the &quot;goose that lays golden eggs&quot; for specialty coffee. Simply having a Gesha coffee can leads to very high prices owing to the demand for the varietal. Whether this is a good thing or not is debatable. You may recall from previous blogs that you can trace the lineage of the Gesha back to Ethiopia, however its recently popularity is due to a farm called Hacienda La Esmeralda. In this case Rodrigo received Gesha seeds from a client in Panama which led to this weeks coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second area of interest for this coffee is the processing method. This method is the brainchild of Finca Monteblanco and has taken around 5 years to perfect. It is described as a &quot;cold fermentation&quot; process. The main steps of the process (after initial sorting) is to depulp the coffee and store them in bags within a temperature-stable cold room for 76 hours. The remaining pulp is then washed off and then the coffee dries for a total of 28 days. In terms of processing this is certianly a slow and relatively laborious method. By keeping the temperature low Rodrigo is able to control the fermentation and not let things get too funky, yet still allow flavour complexity to develop. Of course a process such as this increases the price of the coffee substaintially. To those new to specialty coffee (and even those well versed) - the price of the Icon series of coffees may seem excessive, but a huge amount of work goes into these coffees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive into the coffee proper: on the nose I don't get a huge hit of aroma. This is somewhat expected, Gesha varietals tend to be fairly polite and tend not to be flavour bombs. What you do notice though is sweet and stickly florals such as honeysuckle. Visually this coffee is roasted pretty light, as you'd want for a coffee like this - a heavy roast could mask the natural flavours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a filter this coffee makes an extremely elegant and refined cup. The first thing I noticed is just how clean the cup is, I usually buy cleaner tasting coffees but this is next level. The flavour profile is fairly muted, as you would expect with a Gesha. However there is a lot of complexity there, the main flavour notes for me are honeysuckle and white florals. Alongside delicate melon fruit like sweetness. As the cup cools the florals become more and more present and the aftertaste lingers that little bit longer. I wouldn't recommend this being served cold, but it certainly likes being drunk at a lower temperature than most. Since the cup is so clean you can get away with the lower temperature without getting too much bitterness. Overall the cup is very balanced erring slightly towards the sweeter side rather than the acidic side. There is not a big body or particularly big mouthfeel to the coffee but there is a certain &quot;stickyness&quot; to it which is very pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always with these high-end coffees that only come in &quot;small bags&quot; I did not intend to use them for espresso. With 150g of coffee you get very few chances to dial in, especially if you're also making filter coffees with them. This week however I did use these beans to make 1 espresso - purely by accident, I picked up the wrong bag after a long Zoom meeting when I was fairly tired. The coffee I had dialed in was also a Colombian to a similar roast level so it was not a million miles away but I still don't think it's fair to talk about this coffee too much as an espresso after one showing. The flavour notes were largely the same as with the filter, with no real suprises (other than my shock when I realised I'd used the wrong bag for espresso!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall another great Icon - looking forward to see what part 3 brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are looking at a coffee Icon it seems only fair to pair this with a jazz icon. In this case the 1966 album from Larry Young on Blue Note Records: Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/039-Unity/Unity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An absolutely iconic album from the Blue Note archives. Unity is possibly my favourite album cover of all the Blue Note album artwork - which is saying something when pretty much every one is a classic. Stylistically it is perfect, bold but not overbearing, simple but not boring. Even today this album cover does not look &quot;dated&quot;, it is hard to believe the artwork is now over 50 years old. This just goes to show what a genius Reid Miles was, without his contributions Blue Note may not have been the success it is today. Not only is the music fantastic and recorded well - the overall package and feel of these Blue Note records makes them feel special... Even if, in his own words, Reid Miles &quot;hated jazz&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a roll call of artists who appear on Unity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larry Young – Hammond B-3 organ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woody Shaw – Trumpet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Henderson – Tenor saxophone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elvin Jones – Drums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this alone you can see why this album is deserving of the &quot;Icon&quot; status I've given it. Truly an all-star cast - even at the time without the benefit of knowing what these guys did after Unity was released. We can also see that the line-up, interestingly, does not feature a bass player. This is very important for the sound and overall vibe of the album. Larry has to essentially take on the lower-frequency responsibility - often playing a strong groove to drive the music forward. This creates a rather large amount of space in the mix for the soloists. As a result the music is very experimental and ground-breaking. There are clear nods towards the free-jazz movement of Ornette, the post-bop work of Coltrane and the modal explorations of Davis - and I do not make comparisons to those artists lightly.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXOOpc4OPfs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The use of organs in jazz has always been a bit of a contentious issue for some. The likes of Jimmy Smith and the soul-jazz kind of style heavily rooted in the blues can come across as a bit cornball for some. If this is a sentiment you share Unity is probably the best antidote. While the music is clearly centered around Young's organ sound, it couldn't be further from the soul-jazz sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with a piece penned by trumpet player Shaw called &quot;Zoltan&quot; (embedded at the start of the post). Interestingly enough; the lead artist Young does not have a single writing credit on the album. Zoltan starts off using the march from a Hungarian opera by Zoltán Kodály (no prizes for guessing the inspiration for the name of the piece). Soon after it descends into an exploration of the Lydian mode. The highlight of the tune for me is the incredible solo by Joe Henderson. Here he is at his best, playing &quot;just outside&quot; - it is not quite inside but neither is it full on free, at his best Joe finds that balance perfectly. If you're a fan of Joe's records Inner Urge, Mode for You or In 'n' Out you'll likely recognise some of the licks here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Joe, he also has a writing credit here with the tune &quot;If&quot; (above). This is the most hard-bop-y of all the tunes featured and is a typical Blue Note recording. It is perhaps the most simple tune and closest thing to &quot;straight ahead&quot;. Of course Elvin and Joe have played together many times and so have a near telepathic relationship. They keep the music driving forward and swinging hard, Elvin is in his absolute element here and shows why he is one of the all-time drumming greats. The use of an organ and no bass makes this piece particularly special however. Ordinarily you would expect the band to be rounded out with bass and piano, again the extra space allows the soloists complete freedom in where to go.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aB1H4dJVvvk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The album closes with &quot;Beyond All Limits&quot; another piece penned by Shaw. Harmonically it is the most complicated on the album and features some absolutely mind bending lines. Creating any sort of solo at all over these changes is difficult enough but Henderson, Shaw and Young make it sound easy. You can really hear each soloists personality shine through here: Larry Young's solo to cap off the tune is probably the highlight - as with any good solo he takes what others have played before him and expands upon it, making sure it builds to a crescendo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting just a few tracks from this album is difficult, every one is worthy of comment. We did not even touch on the 2 standards featured: Thelonious Monk's &quot;Monk's Dream&quot; and Hammerstein's &quot;Softly as a Morning Sunrise&quot;. I feel like I say this every week but it is especially relevant this week: this is an album worth hunting down and exploring in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post marks a bit of a milestone for jazz featuring on the blog. A few weeks ago I decided to start a Spotify playlist featuring all the music featured on this blog (you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3WjENhLmpWzdzlxhBxc7Fd?si=LtHGSnTgRu2zN7Uocdlcnw&quot;&gt;here!&lt;/a&gt;) With the tunes in this blog post this playlist now has over 100 tunes and over 12 hours of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are heading back to Brixton's finest: Assembly Coffee roasters. They are regular features on the blog for good reason, it is generally hard to pick a coffee any less than great from them. I'm sure they will crop up on the blog many times during 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee this week is from Guatemala. Surprisingly this is the first coffee from Guatemala to feature on the blog so far. I tend to find Guatemala to be a reliable origin and one I enjoy coming back to. I tend to find them to be extremely balanced and very easy to work with. They're not necessarily associated with the &quot;big&quot; flavours or &quot;wild&quot; tasting notes, but you don't always want that in a coffee. In the past few years I've noticed the quality of Guatemalan coffees going from strength to strength and hopefully they'll continue to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee in question is a washed processed orange bourbon. Orange bourbon is a natural hybrid between the red and yellow bourbon varieties - so named because of the colour of the coffee cherries. I consider the bourbon varietal to be the &quot;old reliable&quot; of the coffee world. There are newer sexier varietals that command the higher prices and esteem but I will always find myself going back to bourbons from time to time. Unfortunately bourbon is very suceptible to leaf rust and other diseases and pests, as a result many bourbon plants have been replaced by other varietals that are more robust in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving straight into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I get a caramel note and a faint hint of a fruitiness. It is not powerful on the nose however, it is not one that will blow your socks off. As I've noted previously this does not necessarily translate to flavours in the cup however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual we start with a filter coffee. The first word that comes to mind with this coffee is &quot;balanced&quot;. The acidity and sweetness is just so perfectly balanced, you have enough acidity to keep things interesting but it is not high acidity by any means. It is actually very easy to drink. In terms of flavour notes I think a crisp green apple is the best description. Assembly use the descriptors: &quot;Lemon Curd and Orange Zest&quot; - I can see what they're getting at with the brightness in the cup but for me it is more like biting into an apple. The sweetness takes the form of a caramel for me - perhaps even a toffee apple. There is a certain amount of mouthfeel and body to the cup, but it is more syrupy than heavy. My one slight negative about the cup is it doesn't cool down well for me, this is one you want to drink quite hot. However, it is so drinkable you'll unlikely have a cup sit around long enough to get to that level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto the espresso. The first thing to note is this one is an absolute dream to dial in, the sweet spot is huge and it's very difficult to go too far wrong. The roast level is fairly light but not excessively so, which I think helps the dialing in. I found that a standard 1:2 and 27s (after 7s pre-infuse) was about right to keep enough of the syrupy body. Given the balance of the coffee going longer doesn't help balance things out anymore. Going shorter to ristretto sort of levels can be nice but I found that the flavours get a little too muddled and I preferred the clarity in the standard ratio. One caveat however is the temperature: this coffee liked my machine to be essentially as hot as it could go. Dropping the temperature led to a slight sourness in the aftertaste which I didn't care for. When made in this way the shot was syrupy, balanced with just the right amount of acidity coming through. As with the filter crisp green apple and caramel were my main flavour notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall another solid showing from the folks at Assembly, worth picking up a bag if these flavour notes are speaking to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side I have been listening to the fantastic live album (recorded in Toronto 1975) by the late great Jim Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/038-Jim-Hall/Jim-Hall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a guitar player since I was around 11 years old, however I have never been a huge fan of many jazz guitarists. Most of the time I'd rather listen to horn, trumpet or piano players. There are a few jazz guitarists who had a profound effect on me however and Jim Hall is certainly in that list. I picked up this album relatively early in my jazz journey and I remember not being particularly moved by it at the time, however as my ear has grown over the years it is one I keep finding myself coming back to.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/d62pCIkbI1Y&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Jim started his career in the Chico Hamilton quintet during the mid 1950s before moving on to Jimmy Giuffre's band. The rest of his side-man resume reads like a who's-who of the jazz world featuring names such as Paul Desmond, Art Farmer, Bill Evans, Sonny Stitt, Stan Getz, Lee Konitz and countless others. He is perhaps best known, however, for his work with Sonny Rollins. In particular the album: &quot;The Bridge&quot; which was the first to appear after Sonny's hiatus and featured the new &quot;piano-less&quot; format for the Rollins group. &quot;The Bridge&quot; changed everything in terms of jazz guitar, it acted as a blueprint for jazz guitar comping for decades after it and went to show that the guitar could functionally replace the piano in a group. Any jazz guitar player owes a great deal of gratitude for Jim Hall for doing this, without him later players such as Pat Metheny, John Scofield and Bill Frisell would unlikely be drawing the attention they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album in question today: &quot;Live!&quot; was recorded in 1975 when Jim was already a well established name and at the top of is game. It was recorded in Toronto's Bourbon Street Jazz Club - fitting given we looked at an orange bourbon coffee varietal this week. It features Don Thompson on bass and Terry Clarke on drums. Much of Jim's playing is about band interaction, his play essentially &quot;reflects&quot; the ideas of whoever he is playing with back to them. This allows every member to sound &quot;more like themselves&quot; and raises the music to a higher level. This is something that I feel had a profound effect on Bill Frisell who's playing has a similar quality in a more modern setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album itself is entirely made up of standards. The playing of familiar tunes allows the trio to really explore the music freely and express themselves. A lot of the exploration takes place in the subtlties, while it's possible to listen to this album without paying much attention it really rewards those looking deeper. You can hear each band member picking up on the phrasing of each others lines. Jim's sparse comping style is on full display in such a stripped back environment. You can also hear his use of dynamics, something that a lot of jazz guitar players overlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a live album of course there are imperfections: you can hear the audience clinking their glasses in places and there are some notes that I imagine would have been &quot;fixed&quot; on a studio release. However more than most other live albums I can think of it really captures the feeling of a small jazz club.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJHf22tJ_a0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

If you've not heard Jim Hall or this album before I strongly suggest finding a copy. For the particularly keen you can also find &quot;Live vol 2-4&quot; which is essentially an extension of this album and features additional music recorded at Bourbon Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
