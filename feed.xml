&lt;/center&gt;

This week  marks the next installment in the KaffeBox subscription series. The April installment features April Coffee Roasters (I see what they did there, very punny). April are a roaster based in Copenhagen, Denmark. They are a roaster I've wanted to try for a while but the shipping costs/times mean I rarely stray outside of UK based roasters and when I do I like to stick to roasters I know and love. I was therefore very happy to see April coffees arrive this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may recall my Kaffebox subscription consists of 2 different 125g bags of coffee each month (both roasted for filter). This is not enough to dial in both filter and espresso comfortably so I dedicate one to filter duty and one to espresso duty. This month I selected based on origin and what I tend to prefer for each coffee style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off with the filter side of things we have a washed coffee from Ethiopia. It is from the Arsosala washing station in Guji, and what is interesting about this coffee is it is a Bourbon cultivar. Typically with Ethiopia you get &quot;heirloom&quot; or &quot;mixed landrace&quot; cultivars (although the specific cultivars are increasingly being identified). On the dry aroma I get caramel and candy notes along with the typical florals you would expect from a washed Ethiopian. In the cup we are treated to a very clean profile, it is refined and delicate. We have a very perfumed and floral cup with a lot of complexity that evolves as the temperature cools. Alongside we have lemon-y citrus notes and a sweet sugar-syrup vibe. The aftertaste and finish are extremely clean and fairly short lived, body is low and the acidity level is medium. It is a very good example of what a washed Guji Ethiopian should be, and the sort of coffee I can drink by the pint and still enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the espresso side we have a Costa Rican coffee from the Volcan Azul farm. The cultivar in question is H17 which is a hybrid cultivar. It is not one I am familiar with (I have had H3 a few times) and I can't find out many details about the exact genetic make-up. The coffee has undergone a yellow honey processing. This coffee has really blown me away as an espresso. I find honey processed Costa Ricans the most forgiving bean for espresso typically but this was a whole different level of forgiving - every single thing I tried was fantastic. It made choosing an &quot;ideal&quot; recipe next to impossible. In the end I just went to a regular 1:2 ratio so I could appreciate the thicker rich mouthfeel. The flavours on show were hazelnut, almond, honey, sugar-syrup and plum. It is not the most complicated coffee I've ever had but it is incredibly drinkable and enjoyable - it is just a great example of what espresso can be. Again like with the filter the coffee is very clean and the aftertaste is fairly shortlived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall 2 very strong showings from April, I'll certainly be on the lookout for coffees from them in the past. When I'm feeling flush I might splash out on some of their more exclusive Gesha offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side we are taking a first look at a 2021 release from Code Quartet - &quot;Genealogy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/054-Genealogy/Genealogy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Quartet are a relatively new project and &quot;Genealogy&quot; represents their debut which was released on April 23rd 2021. The band formed 4 years ago in Montreal, Canada. The idea behind the project was to explore &quot;chord-less&quot; music and they cite the Ornette Coleman groups from the 1950s as a primary influence. They also list the work of Fletcher Henderson, Charlie Haden and Paul Bley as influencing their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quartet is made up of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christine Jensen - saxophones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lex French - trumpet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adrian Vedady - acoustic bass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jim Doxas - drums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By forgoing instruments with the ability to play chords they open up many possibilities within the music. The roles of &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot; players become a little harder to define and it becomes more about the interplay between instruments. On this particular project there seems to be around a 50:50 split between the compositional and improvisational aspects and it is evident that the musicians are very comfortable playing with each other, this allows them to take plenty of risks and push the boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the influences listed above the opening track &quot;Tipsy&quot; (embedded at the start of the post) sounds more like a tune you'd hear on a Hank Mobley record than an Ornette Coleman one, but this is no bad thing. The focus of the tune is the funky-soul jazz swing. Jensen taking a tasty Rollins inspired solo part way through. It is not the most complex or original piece you'll ever hear but it is a style that you don't hear explored much anymore so it is a nice surprise to open the album.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yELcAAU_p40&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Perhaps the most complex piece on the album is &quot;Wind Up&quot; (above), here the band strays more into the Coleman inspired &quot;free&quot; style. The tune is based around quite a complicated rhythmic figure but Doxas manages to keep things grooving and it doesn't sound like a &quot;music degree show piece&quot; like many modern jazz pieces do. Over the top we have a twisting harmonic idea which shows the Jensen-French interplay off to full effect. Each player manages to serve the music and each other but there is still a sense of individual expression: Jensen going for a wilder outside staccato playing style while French sticks to more inside flowing legato ideas. The contrast works well together and it never feels like a &quot;jam session&quot; comprised of a random set of musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really makes this album interesting however is the sheer variety of music on show. The two tracks listed above are very different but share the same &quot;DNA&quot;. This is echoed throughout the entire album - we have the (very clearly) Coleman influenced title track which would have fit right in on a 50s album from Ornette. Alongside we have the more angular modern jazz influenced &quot;Watching It All Slip Away&quot;. The track &quot;Day Moon&quot; feels like it was inspired by &quot;Tijuana Moods&quot; era Charles Mingus and the album closes with &quot;Beach Community&quot; which has a Carribean-lilt which shows more than a passing resemblence to the Rollins classic &quot;St Thomas&quot;. The quartet covers quite a wide variety of jazz history in just the 51 minute play time of the album, however do not think of this as a &quot;covers band&quot; - there is a very definitely &quot;Code Quartet&quot; sound on show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall this is a strong debut album. It is definitely a little &quot;rough around the edges&quot; in places but this kind of adds to its charm. Unlike many modern jazz offerings they do not let perfection be the enemy of the good. &quot;Code Quartet&quot; will definitely be a group I'll keep an ear-out for in the future as this debut shows a lot of promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week on the blog we are looking at another &quot;limited edition&quot; coffee - this time from the Brixton based Assembly Coffee Roasters (one of this blogs favourite roasters). Assembly do not release &quot;limited&quot; coffees very often (I believe this is only the 5th or so they've ever offered), so expectations are high for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself is from famed Colombian producer: Diego Bermudez. Widely regarded as one of the best producers for &quot;experimental processing&quot; in the world. They are really pushing the boundaries of coffee processing with meticulous attention to detail and a careful approach. They are based in El Tambo, Cauca - located in the south-west corner of Colombia slightly towrards the border with Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself is of Castillo cultivar, in its lineage there are some robusta-arabica hybrids which made Castillo a bit of a &quot;controversial&quot; cultivar in the past with the specialty movement. This seems to have largely died down now however and people are appreciating the quality in the cup - typically considered on par with Typica, Bourbon, etc. The really cool part of the Castillo cultivar however is its resistance to leaf rust, a growing concern for global coffee production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that makes this coffee special however is its processing. Whole cherries are fermented anaerobically for 48 hours at a strict 18 degrees celcius. Following this cherries are de-pulped and they go back in to anaerobically ferment for another 48 hours, this time at 20 celcius. The coffee then undergoes a &quot;thermal shock&quot; washing process whereby an initial washing at 40 celcius occurs, followed by a much cooler 12 celcius wash. The resulting beans then undergo a temperature controlled drying at 35 celcius until the moisture level reaches 10-11%. This is a really complicated multi-stage process so it is understandable that this is a higher priced &quot;limited&quot; coffee, the question is: does it make a difference in the cup?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual we start by looking at the dry aroma: this coffee is a bit of a &quot;fruit bomb&quot;. The aroma is incredibly sweet and there are tropical fruits aplenty - pineapples, papaya, passionfruits, honeydew melon and a fair few more. Certainly an enticing start to this coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving over to the filter: again the sweetness is evident. It has an almost sugar-syrup quality both in terms of sweetness but also body which is quite big for a coffee roasted so lightly. Again the main flavours of note are the punchy tropical fruits: passionfruit is listed as a taste note on the label and it's hard to disagree with that really. I would add that there are floral background notes to this one too, it's not a perfumed Ethiopian but in the aftertaste there are certainly hints of lavendar. The cup is extremely complex and takes on a number of different characters as it cools, there's a stage where the tropical fruits give way to more &quot;traditional&quot; plum and raspberry type notes which is a nice surprise. In terms of acidity I would say this is at the mid-high end of things, and despite such a &quot;heavy&quot; processing the cup remains clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the espresso I found this coffee a little finnicky to dial in. It is prone to being a little too sharp and acidic unless you nail the grind size. Once dialed in however it is a delight. I settled on a med-high heat level on my machine, a 5s pre-infuse followed by a 24s pull aiming for a ratio of 1:2.2 was what I settled on. By going a little shorter than one might expect with a filter roast left the syrupy mouthfeel in tact and the coffee has enough sweetness that there's no need to go any longer. Again the tropical fruit salad was the major flavour profile and the sweetness was very very high. Once dialed in a very enjoyable and drinkable espresso and one I'm sad to see the back of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all another knockout coffee from Assembly, hopefully they can bring us many more interesting limited editions to wrap our tastebuds around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week the magic of &quot;shuffle&quot; reminded me of a fun album from 1998 - Stanton Moore's debut album &quot;All Kooked Out&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/053-All-Kooked-Out/All-Kooked-Out.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanton Moore may not be a name you have heard often before - at least if you're on this side of the atlantic. He is a drummer from New Orleans who is very much a part of the scene over there. He has a few recordings under his own name and as part of groups &quot;Galactic&quot; and &quot;Garage A Trois&quot; - each featuring a &quot;jazz funk meets jam band&quot; sort of vibe. In the late 90s through mid 00s the &quot;jazz-funk-jam&quot; thing was a fairly big scene thanks to the likes of Medeski Martin and Wood. In recent times Stanton has also become a drum educator.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEcZy2gRsK0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

On &quot;All Kooked Out&quot; Stanton is joined by two musicians who he worked with previously through the &quot;Galactic&quot; group: 8 string guitarist Charlie Hunter and saxophonist Skerik. There are others rounding out the lineup but the real highlight of the album is hearing these 3 work together. The album was recorded in a week long session in a &quot;live&quot; style: there were no overdubs, they just play through the tunes. I really enjoy recordings done this way as you can hear the players excitement and energy come through, with too many edits the soul can be sucked from the music - especially for &quot;funk&quot; styles which are more about attitude than perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Hunter is likely the &quot;biggest name&quot; on this album. During the 2000s he became somewhat of a &quot;poster boy&quot; of jazz guitar, he is known for playing 8 and 7 string guitars that are in some sense &quot;hybrid&quot; guitar and bass. This allows him to play basslines, chords and melodies simultaneously giving him plenty of freedom in composing and improvising. I have to admit I never got as &quot;into&quot; Hunter as many people are, I can appreciate his talent and ability but I don't often dig out his records to listen to. On &quot;All Kooked Out&quot; however he is a perfect fit, he has some great funk chops and the interplay with Stanton is great throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skerik really adds another dimension to this album. He is listed as playing: &quot;saxophonics and kookification&quot; on the album - the latter being a good descriptor. By combining his saxophone with various electronics and effects he is able to provide some &quot;other worldly&quot; sounds to the album. This elevates the album from being just another &quot;jazz-funk&quot; album to something a bit special. A lot of what sticks in your mind from this album is Skerik's contributions - at least for me. It is not just a bunch of &quot;tricks&quot; though, he provides some really musical solos throughout too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with the track &quot;Tchfunkta&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) - which sets the tone for the rest of the album. As the name suggests it is based around a funk groove driven forward via Stanton's drums, Charlie's heavily chorused guitar (which admittedly sounds a bit dated now) dances over the top and the flourishes are added by Skerik. This is largely the formula throughout the album. One of the more interesting pieces is &quot;Stanton Hits the Bottle&quot; (above) - where Stanton literally hits the bottle rather than his drum kit for the percussion track. A cute idea, a fun play on words and a rather good track in its own right.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OvyqNwzj3XM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;All Kooked Out&quot; is unlikely to be an &quot;earth shattering&quot; album that will completely change your views on jazz. However it is an easy album to listen to and is certainly enjoyable. It is worth hunting down if you have not heard it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week on the blog we are looking at another coffee from Plot Coffee Roasting. I initially did not intend to write about this coffee on the blog, I was keeping it as my &quot;espresso option&quot; while enjoying the Icon Series 4 from last week's blog. However 2 things forced it up the agenda: 1) it is a cool and interesting coffee and 2) I need a bit more time to dial in the next coffee I am going to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee this week is called: Andreas Cortes - Pink Bourbon by Plot themselves. Andreas being owner of Finca Eucaliptos in Pitaltio, Huila, Colombia - where this coffee originates. By this point you'll also realise we're looking at a pink bourbon cultivar. Pink bourbon is a hybrid of the more common red and yellow bourbons (named after the colour of their fruit). This hybrid is hard to grow and hard to isolate so it is relatively rare. It is noted, however, that it generally offers high cup scores and has shown good (or at least better) resistance to leaf rust - which is of course a big bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself undergoes a 24 hour resting period before being de-pulped and fermented for 60 hours in sealed bags before being fully washed and dried on patios for 18 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving straight into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I don't get a huge amount of anything coming off. I would describe it mostly as a &quot;neutral sweet&quot; quality, like opening a bag of caster sugar. With a bit more focus you can just about pick off some citrus and floral notes but they are very feint. As we've stated many times before: this doesn't necessarily mean much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto the filter option: forewarning here - I only had 1 cup of filter from this coffee, so these are genuine initial responses. The first thing I jotted down with this coffee was &quot;clean&quot; - not just due to flavour clarity but profile too. There is a big citrus-y hit in the front, pink grapefruits and lemons mostly. These give a very clean quality to the cup. Following that I get a bit of a resin-y pine-needle sort of quality, again giving a fresh and airy vibe to the cup. In the aftertaste there are delicate floral notes that, while not particularly strong, do have staying power. In terms of sweetness vs acidity - for me it lies a little more to the acidic side but there is a plenty of sweetness in this cup too. The mouthfeel is quite big, adding to the resin-y pine-needle note I mentioned previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my time with this coffee has been via espresso - to me this is where this coffee is right at home. Dialling it in is a little finnicky, it is a light roast designed for filter primarily, and you need to whack the machine temp right up (one day I forgot to do this and left the machine cool from a dark decaf roast I was drinking the previous night - it did not work well with this coffee at all). In terms of ratio I got to about 1:2.25 as a sweetspot, 7s pre-infuse then a 27s pull. The results are outstanding. The shot is extremely vibrant and zingy, sort of like a very crisp lemonade with a big slice of pink-grapefruit in it. I could see some people despising this as an espresso for being too acidic and bright but I enjoyed it a lot. While it's bright and crisp it doesn't stray into &quot;battery acid&quot; territory at all for me. Even when I didn't nail it when dialing in the results were just a bit flat as opposed to being a sink job. The margin between fantastic and average with this one are quite fine though I found, it took me a few shots to really get things where they needed to be - but then I was handsomely rewarded for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week I dug out a record from 2010 from the band Soulive, in the form of their tribute to The Beatles: &quot;Rubber Soulive&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/052-Rubber-Soulive/Rubber-Soulive.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I was late to the Soulive party. The band started by releasing their debut EP in 1999 with their debut LP coming a year later. I knew of them around the mid-2000s but didn't really give them much attention at that time, Medeski Martin and Wood were more my thing so I was pretty big on them. It wasn't until the late 2000s when I really became aware of them. I was working on a new musical project at the time and the bassist of the band lent me a pile of CDs of his biggest influences - a couple of these were Soulive records, and I became to realise what I had been missing out on.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXGwagOpjQs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

As you could likely guess from the name: &quot;Soulive&quot; are largely in the &quot;Soul Jazz&quot; mold. They tend to have catchy, uptempo tunes that span jazz-soul-funk-rock. They have experimented (a lot) with additional musicians and vocalists over the years but the core of the band is an organ trio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alan Evans - Drums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neil Evans - Organ/Piano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric Kranso - Guitar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is the lineup featuring on &quot;Rubber Soulive&quot;. They rip through 11 tunes from The Beatles back catalogue, sticking solely to the &quot;big hits&quot; rather than finding the more obscure tracks. As you would expect from a jazz-funk band the focus is well and truly on the groove, if you're looking for a complex re-harmonization of Lennon pieces this is not the one for you. But if you want a groovy jam-band party atmosphere and some familiar melodies you could do a lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my choice cuts on the album is &quot;Revolution&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). Likely everybody will be fairly familiar with this track already so it is not easy to take it in a new direction. The Soulive boys decided instead of leaning into the strong rock-beat of the original they would take it into an RnB direction with a Booker T and the MGs style groove. If you can get through this tune without tapping your feet you are a better man than I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fun track on the album is &quot;Help&quot; (above). Here Soulive go for a tongue-in-cheek swing feeling, almost with a lounge-jazz vibe. As the track goes onthe energy increases and by the end Alan is using a really strong and driving drum beat. The whole track is a lot of fun but also features some rather tasty organ playing from Neil. 

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

Of course the greatest of all The Beatles is George Harrison and there are 3 of his tunes covered on this album. Perhaps the most adventurous of these being the album closer: &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (above). A tune that has been covered to death at this point, with basically every guitar player having played it at some point. It is therefore quite difficult to come up with a &quot;fresh&quot; take on it, but I feel Soulive achieve that here. They stick pretty closely to the original melody and harmony throughout. Instead adding colour through groove and timbre. Some of Eric's phrasing in particular is very tasty, as are the tasteful use of effects which add rather than detract from the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall a fun little album to check out. It's not one that will require a great deal of effort to listen to, just an easy &quot;feel good&quot; sort of album. Not all jazz need be complicated and require a great deal of effort to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This coming friday (16th April) marks the first anniversary of the JazzCoffeeStuff blog! Unintentionally this coincides with another special coffee from Plot Coffee Roasting through their Icon series. As you may remember the Icon series is a &quot;150g a month&quot; subscription offered by Plot featuring some of the most sought after and rare coffees availavle. This is the 4th edition of this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee in question is from Ecuador, an origin that may not be familiar to some. Most think of cacao rather than coffee from Ecuador, but those familiar with the specialty coffee scene know that there are some fantastic coffees to be had. Perhaps what is most interesting about this coffee is the cultivar: Typica Mejorado. I admit that I don't think I've ever tried this particular cultivar before, apparently a cross between Bourbon and an unknown Ethiopian landrace. Certainly an intriguing proposition given the cup quality of both of these cultivars. Interestingly, doing some research a few sources claim that it is a cross between Bourbon and Gesha - but this seems to be speculative at best (although would likely help achieve a higher price for the coffee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processing here is a natural. Ecuador has a fairly humid climate which makes natural processing problematic. This coffee undergoes a dry fermentation for 48 hours before spending 15 days in a solar powered drying chamber that exactly controls the coffees environment. Following this the coffee spends the rest of the time on raised African beds within a polytunnel. This sort of attention to detail at the processing stage is really what sets some of these super high scoring coffees a part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's just dive right in: on the dry aroma I get a strong punch of honey straight off the bat. In addition I get the sort of floral notes one would ordinarily associate with Ethiopian coffees. This coffee is off to a good start, as usual we move on to my usual pour-over - I'm currently still on Hario v60 papers instead of my usual chemex due to supply chain issues but have been appreciating the change. Taking the first sip immediately I'm struck by how sweet this coffee is, it is syrup-y sugar-y and honey-y. This is up there as one of the sweetest coffees I've had in a while, if you like sweetness it is one for you. In terms of flavour profile the honey-floral combo is certainly there - a hit of honey at the front which mellows to perfumed florals in the aftertaste. In the middle however it is a bit of a fruit bomb: strawberry is certainly present, apricots too, mangos and papaya make a bit of a showing. There is a lot going on in the cup, it is one that you should really sit down and savour but it is surprisingly easy to drink too. In terms of acidity I would describe it as low or at a push medium, there's so much sweetness it's kind of hard to notice the acidity in my opinion. The body is quite high but not one of those coffees that you can chew on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous Icon coffees I didn't make any espresso, next week's blog post should feature some espresso goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again Plot knock it out of the park with their Icon series. 4 out of 4 bangers so far, and I am looking forward to next month's offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this friday marks the one year anniversary of JazzCoffeeStuff, on the jazz side I thought we should head back to the first artist featured: Joe Henderson with another of his Blue Note recordings &quot;In 'N Out&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/051-InNOut/InNOut.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before even getting into the music itself it is worth taking a moment to appreciate the album artwork. One of my favourite covers in the history of Blue Note, a near perfect example of the Reid Miles aesthetic. It still looks as fresh today as it did when the album was released in January 1965.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make no apologies: I am a huge Joe Henderson fan. My love for his playing can be summed up in the title of this album: &quot;In 'N Out&quot; - for me nobody before or since has had the ability to walk the line between inside and outside playing. He has the ability to play the craziest free-jazz lines fit with the most pedestrian chord changes, and meanwhile play an absolutely pure and simple melody in the midst of a free-jazz frenzy. Sometimes he even can start a lick playing a blues and by the end be in the realms of avant-garde - and you don't even notice it. This is especially true for his playing on Blue Note around this period, you can pick up any record he appears on during this time and you'll be blown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &quot;In 'N Out&quot; the supporting cast isn't too shabby either: on trumpet you have regular stable-mate Kenny Dorham, with whom Joe recorded many times - all of which magical. On piano we have McCoy Tyner - one of the true stars of the hard-bop era and again appears regularly with Joe. On the bass we have Richard Davis who has played on records spanning all of the sub-genres of jazz from bop to free. On the drums is Elvin Jones - possibly my favourite drummer of all time, he always finds a unique way of swinging and can only be described as a jazz legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with the title track (embedded at the start of this post). It kicks off with a time-twisting hard-bop type melody with Joe and Kenny in unison (showing off their near telepathic communication). This is on top of a typical Elvin swing - his way of emphasing the beat gives the melody a hurried chaotic feeling. It doesn't take too long to get into Joe's first solo on the album. It features all the hallmarks of his playing: short stabby phrases, the unpredictable use of space, large intervals, ghost notes and trills. With so many &quot;tricks&quot; like these it's amazing at how well Joe can construct a solo, it's completely logical and flows from one idea to the next. McCoy then takes his turn, again sticking to his tried and tested use of fourths (mostly). Kenny then takes his turn with perhaps one of the most daring solos in his back catalogue. Typically you associate Kenny with the latin-influenced music and sticking fairly close to the melody but here he gets a little more experimental.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/78N6qHZdxYY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The album itself consists of 2 parts: the first 3 tracks being tunes penned by Henderson himself and the last 2 by Dorham. As one would expect the Dorham tunes feature a latin and bossa feel, in contrast to the hard-bop/free sound of the Henderson pieces. One of the Dorham pieces is &quot;Short Story&quot; (above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Short Story&quot; is typical Dorham through and through but the personnel on this album takes it in a different direction. You have Elvin's drum beats adding a unique flavour to the latin piece. It would have been easy to just stick to the &quot;typical&quot; drum beats featured in latin jazz but Elvin's genius gives the piece a sort of rhythmic tension which can be released at any moment. You also have McCoy's &quot;modal chord&quot; style of comping which gives the piece an almost &quot;dream like&quot; feel. Then you have Davis' bass hook which is a real ear-worm. This sets the stage for the main soloists to show off their personality: Dorham sticks largely to the chord tones and stays inside, playing pretty phrases. In contrast Joe starts off well behaved but before long starts breaking out the wolf-notes and wild rollercoaster bop lines. The Henderson/Dorham partnership is something that will never get old, they just seemed to raise each other up every time they played together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one downside of &quot;In 'N Out&quot; is its brevity at just 5 tracks and around 38 minutes (reissues featuring an additional 9 minutes with an alternate take of the title track). In spite of this &quot;In 'N Out&quot; is an all time classic for me and one well worth your time to hunt down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week on the blog we are yet again visiting Plot Coffee Roasters - a near constant feature in the blog as of late. This time we have a rather neat competition winning lot from Peru. The lot is from Laura Nilva Paye located in the Puno department of the country. In terms of location this is the south easterly corner of Peru, close to the border with Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultivar of this coffee is Bourbon. I have been reminded that my sloppy use of the word &quot;varietal&quot; is technically incorrect when referring to coffee. In layman's terms the difference between &quot;varietal&quot; and &quot;cultivar&quot; is the presence of human intervention - in coffee (essentially) all coffee plants have been selectively bred, hence they should be referred to as &quot;cultivar&quot; as opposed to &quot;varietal&quot;. This is something I often forget and end up referring to varietal but I'll try and be more precise in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot label this coffee as a &quot;washed&quot; process, however looking into the details the coffee has been depulped and fermented for 20-24 hours before being washed. In that sense it is a little more &quot;honey&quot; than many washed coffees available. Following the washing stage the coffee is dried under shade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not hang around but get straight down to business: on the dry aroma I get sweet caramel and peaches, but they are very feint. Overall the coffee doesn't have a huge bouquet when compared to others, but it is very appealling I have a sense this will be a coffee I'll like. As I've said before the dry aroma (or lack thereof) doesn't necessarily align with what ends up in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into the filter; it is clear to see how much quality is in this cup. It is very clean and clear, every flavour is well defined. The first thing that hits me is the sweetness, it has a very sticky-sweet vibe like a really ripe peach or even a peach syrup. After the intial stone fruit hit subsides you're left with a stunning floral finish which is clean and long lasting. The notes from Plot say: &quot;a flavour profile more akin to Ethiopia than Peru&quot; and it is very hard to argue with that. In terms of acidity I would describe it as a medium, or it may be that all the sweetness just offsets it. Eitherway it is a very easy cup to drink but also has layers of complexity to keep you entertained. I find it's best enjoyed at a slightly cooler temperature, straight out of the brewer the flavours get a bit too muddled for my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto espresso: I found it basically impossible to get a bad shot out of this. You can basically pull it however you like, with any grind setting and it'll be great. I was without electricity for a day and even pulled a shot on my cafelat robot and it was perhaps the best shot I had. I love the robot as a manual espresso maker, but I struggle with the lighter filter roasts I favour for espresso because it is hard to keep the temperature high enough. No problem with this coffee though, it still extracted perfectly. I found most enjoyment pulling the shots a little shorter that 1:2 to get a more luxurious caramel mouthfeel. The flavour profile in the cup is pure condensed peach and apricot. It is like a shot of peach syrup, incredibly high sweetness, just enough balancing acidity and no harshness at all. As much as I enjoyed this coffee in a filter, for me it really shone as an espresso - up there with the best of the year so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we're heading back to a classic Blue Note recording from 1965 - &quot;Basra&quot; by Pete La Roca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/050-Basra/Basra.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete &quot;La Roca&quot; Sims is a drummer/percussionist - he is best known as a sideman having appeared alongside some of the all time greats: Sonny Rollins (Roca appeared albeit briefly on &quot;Live at the Vanguard&quot;), Joe Henderson (on &quot;Page One&quot;), Jackie McLean, Bill Evans, Sonny Clark and so on. He started his career however playing in latin bands, an influence that came through in his playing throughout his career. There are a few things interesting about Pete: firstly he despised the name &quot;La Roca&quot; - he came up with the moniker early in his career and it is how most people knew him, but he regretted it in later life. Secondly he was in some sense a &quot;part timer&quot; - throughout the 60s he made money as an NY taxi driver and later became a lawyer in the 70s returning to jazz just once after this.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3M1O7InNT14&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;La Roca&quot; only has 3 albums under his own name, and one of those was erroniously labelled as a &quot;Chick Corea&quot; album by the record label initially. It's for that reason I consider &quot;Basra&quot; to be a bit of an &quot;under the radar classic&quot;. I'm not a fan of labels like &quot;under the radar&quot; or &quot;underrated&quot; since they always bring out arguments of &quot;XXXX is less well known, so this isn't underrated&quot; eventually devolving into an excuse for showing how obscure ones musical tastes are. I consider &quot;Basra&quot; an &quot;under the radar classic&quot; however, because almost every &quot;experienced&quot; jazz fan I know loves the album but it will rarely (if ever) feature on a &quot;top 100 albums&quot; list and &quot;La Roca&quot; will never feature in a list of artists you &quot;have to hear&quot; - as a result this is an album that many do not discover until much later in their jazz journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes the album so special? Firstly the line up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pete &quot;La Roca&quot; - Drums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Henderson - Tenor Sax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steve Swallow - Bass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steve Kuhn - Piano
As with many Blue Note recordings from around this time: a true heavyweight line-up. But more than that: &quot;Basra&quot; features some truly explorative playing. It is not your typical &quot;hard bop&quot; album, the is a darker brooding attitude and vibe throughout. The players also lean into the avant-garde/free styles more than many other albums of the period. But more than that there are influences outside of the typical &quot;jazz&quot; paradigm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps most evident in the title track &quot;Basra&quot; (embedded at the start of the blog). A take on Middle Eastern classical music it is based around one chord and captures the &quot;meditative&quot; essence of the style. The &quot;blank canvas&quot; allows Joe to carve out any line he wants and it is some of the best lead playing you'll hear from Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the firey &quot;Malaguena&quot; (above) which is a piece originally penned by Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona (again &quot;La Roca&quot; tipping his hat towards the latin music he played in his early career.) Again Joe plays out of his skin and there are plenty of &quot;Henderson-isms&quot; throughout which is no bad thing. The piece manages to be energetic without being high tempo, the quartet masterfully keeps racheting up the tension as it goes on but somehow manages to swing. 

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/briljflpx2s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Basra&quot; also features the original recording of the Swallow tune: &quot;Eiderdown&quot; which later went on to be a Swallow signature tune and a standard in its own right. It is interesting to hear it in its &quot;original&quot; form here. It is perhaps the most &quot;straight ahead&quot; of all the tunes on the album and Swallow's bass keeps the tune driving forward in his own inimitable way. This is also one of the recordings shortly before Steve switched to electric bass entirely, so it is nice to hear him play with an acoustic instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all &quot;Basra&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the greatest recordings on Blue Note. Definitely hunt out a copy through whatever medium you use to consume your music. It is a shame we have so few records of &quot;La Roca&quot; under his own name, it would have been great to see where he would have taken his music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are back with another installment of the KaffeBox subscription. Recall the KaffeBox subscription highlights a different Scandinavian roaster each month. This month was particularly exciting for me since it featured one of my all time favourite roasters: Morgon Coffee Roasters - who I do not buy from nearly enough due to the logistics of getting the coffee here to London. The roastery is located in Gotherburg, Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I noticed about Morgon is their aesthetic vision. Everything from their website, to instagram account to the bags themselves are really well put together. Each bag is blue in colour and features a picture depicting the flavour profile of the coffee inside. The images are really works of art in themselves, and this gives the impression of great quality even before opening the bag. As an example, here is an image from one of the bags we are looking at today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/049-Sun-Blowing/Ferney-Cruz.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly some of the best looking packaging out there in my mind. As with previous KaffeBox subscriptions I have 2 different 125g bags to play around with. This is not enough to dial in an espresso and make filter coffees with so I split the coffees - one for espresso duties and one for filter duties. This time I did it at random, when making the first filter coffee I just reached for a bag on the shelf and that's how it was assigned. Note that both coffees are &quot;filter&quot; roast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the filter option: we have a washed Ethiopian coffee from the Uraga Raro washing station located in the Guji zone - an area that crops up frequently on this blog. Morgon don't provide much more information than that, which is not a problem - we can move swiftly on to what matters: the coffee itself. On the dry aroma you get your &quot;typical&quot; washed Ethiopian qualities: citrus fruits and florals. As you would expect it is not a really punchy hard hitting coffee on the nose. In the cup you get everything you expect from a coffee like this: elegant earl-grey tea-like flavours, citrus-y blood orange and grapefruit sharpness and a very refined balance to the cup. This is just a top drawer example of what washed Ethiopian coffees are all about, there is so much clarity it allows the complexity to come through and allows you to enjoy the cup at the cooler temperatures. This is what I like and respect about the Morgon offerings I've had in the past - they're just completely dependable. They seem to respect the origin and each one is a top quality example of what a particular region is all about. No nonsense, just really good quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the espresso side we have a washed Caturra from Colombia - Ferney Cruz. Again not a whole lot of information here so we'll dive right in. On the nose I get hits of sweet &quot;red&quot; fruits like strawberry, raspberry and rhubarb, again it's not a big hitter but certainly enough to draw you in. Dialing this one in for espresso was a bit of a pain, this is a coffee where you need to set your grinder very fine. I was just past the point of burrs touching and I could just about wrestle a 1:2 in 27s sort of profile out of it. Being a filter roast however, it seems to benefit from a bit of a longer pull. 1:2.5 seems to work best in around 25s with the machine at full temperature. The resulting shot is syrupy sweet. The flavour profile is full of raspberry and rhubarb - if you imagine a pineapple cube sweet but made with rhubarb I don't think you'd be far off the mark. Again the coffee is very clean, especially in the aftertaste - qualities I like in a coffee. Again it is just a very very good example of a clean washed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to drink some more Morgon coffees this month, it reminds me that I should order from them more often. If you're after &quot;fireworks&quot;, crazy processing, loud punchy flavours - Morgon probably aren't the ones to go to (at least in my experience). But if you want complete quality and elegant clean cups Morgon are certainly up there with the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week I found myself digging out an album from 2016 by the trio of Lars Danielsson, Marius Neset and Morten Lund on the ACT label - &quot;Sun Blowing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/049-Sun-Blowing/Sun-Blowing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story behind this album is that Danielsson, Neset and Lund met by chance on a train in 2012 - they had not met each other before, let alone played together. Two years after this happy accident they decided to record &quot;Sun Blowing&quot; - representing an &quot;intial encounter&quot; in the studio. The line-up here represents a &quot;tenor-sax-trio&quot; format with Neset on tenor, Danielsson on bass and Lund on drums. We have spoken about trio formats like this in the past on this blog - many sax players try and play in this context but few succeed. With so much space and freedom it really exposes the sax so you need to be on top of your game. Neset, however, is no ordinary sax player. A bit of a &quot;prodigy&quot; and one of the most accomplished young sax players out there. In contrast to his solo work which typically contains large ensembles, it is rare to see Neset play in such an intimate setting.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqCQnjVxXQE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Being a &quot;first encounter&quot; there is a lot of energy and vibrancy on show on the album. As you'd expect from a trio of this format there is a big influence from the tenor greats: Coltrane, Rollins, Brecker, Henderson and so on. However there is also a lot of influence from the avant-garde and free sides too particularly from the early ECM records. While it would be easy to release an album of Neset just blowing over changes and showing off his chops, the guys here have worked on creating actual tunes. I think of Neset as a very thematic player, although he has chops his primary focus seems to be on creating themes and movements in the music. This gives his playing a &quot;story-telling&quot; sort of quality, this makes the tunes very memorable and they often stick in your head for days after hearing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with &quot;Little Jump&quot; (embedded at the start of this post), here Neset's playing is somewhere between Sonny Rollins and Michael Brecker. In the rhythm section Danielsson plays some of the grooviest, funkiest bass lines on the album and drives the tune forward. Behind it all however is Lund's modulating drum beat, he pulls and drags the time throughout masterfully. The interplay between Danielsson and Lund throughout is incredible also, it almost feels like a live gig with the energy flowing between the trio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tune of note on the album is &quot;Up North&quot; (above), the main theme of which has a folk/Americana sort of vibe. This is an influence that comes up a few times throughout the album, this is even in reflected in the title of one of the pieces &quot;Folksong&quot;. On &quot;Up North&quot; there is more than a hint of Joe Henderson to Neset's playing - if you're familiar with this blog you'll know I see this as no bad thing.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_FPZZx0oos&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Sun Blowing&quot; is comprised entirely of original pieces apart from the Don Grolnick penned &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; (above) which closes the album. This is one of the lower tempo pieces on the album and it features some beautiful soloing from Danielsson. We are also treated to a masterclass from Lund who builds the energy just enough to punctuate the crescendo of each solo before bringing us back down again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a jazz album you may have missed in the last decade, &quot;Sun Blowing&quot; is definitely worth your time. It's a little hard to believe this album is 5 years old (7 since it was recorded) - but it still sounds fresh. Given the energy and &quot;story-telling&quot; nature of the tunes it is an easy listen that does not require too much attention. Well worth hunting down a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we're heading back to the Brew Coffee Plus roasters in Streatham. For the second week in a row we're looking at a Gesha varietal coffee - but this time a washed processed example. We have talked about Gesha a few times in the past so we won't retread that ground - suffice to say the past few weeks of coffee have been relatively expensive so I might have to avoid the super-rare lots for a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss if I did not first mention the packaging for this coffee. Since this is a special Gesha coffee, Brew Coffee Plus decided to pull out all the stops with the packaging. The coffee arrived in a thick cardboard box with a magnetic clasp, it reminds me more of a hardback book than it does a coffee box. Yes, it is superfluous and doesn't actually &quot;add&quot; anything to the coffee itself - but I'm a firm believer that subconciously you judge a coffee long before it even reaches the cup and so this certainly does no harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself is from Finca La Esmeralda in Acatenango, Chimaltenango, Guatemala. Seeing the words &quot;La Esmeralda&quot; and &quot;Gesha&quot; on the same page will likely make one think of &quot;Hacienda La Esmeralda&quot; in Panama - but this coffee is unrelated (aside from the obvious sharing of the Gesha varietal). There wasn't too much information provided with the coffee itself but it does state that the owner of the farm is one Mr Hermes and it provides an interesting tidbit that he is working with hybrid varietals. Potentially something to look out for in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive into the coffee itself: in the usual way starting with the dry aroma. The first thing I notice is the nuance in the coffee. You can tell this will be a complex cup from the moment of opening the bag. There are layers upon layers of florals and citrus notes. It's quite hard to pinpoint individual notes here as there is a lot going on, but it is very inviting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a filter this coffee really shines. It is an incredibly clean cup of coffee, one of the cleanest I've had in a while. The main two &quot;themes&quot; of flavour notes are citrus and florals. I would describe the citrus notes as being clemantine in terms of sweetness but with a grapefruit type acidity in their too. You could also argue various other citrus-y type notes too but those are the two that come to mind for me. Once the initial citrus hit subsides you're hit with a wave of florals - jasmines are certainly there and there's a certain honeysuckle type sticky sweetness on show too. The taste notes say &quot;bergamot&quot; which is also a good description. The cup is very complex so picking out a few taste notes is difficult. This cup is also super sensitive to temperature and it takes you on a journey when drinking it. Using any sort of temperature control mug would be a crime against coffee here. I would instead recommend getting a very thin walled drinking vessel so that it cools down quicker as it won't last long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had enough of this coffee that I could experiment with espresso too. It is a roast that is on the lighter end and has delicate floral taste notes which can sometimes lead to a difficult dialing in process. I found the coffee very forgiving however, most things seemed to work well. Ultimately though a longer shot of around 1:2.75 in about 25s worked best for me and the machine wanted to be as hot as it could go. Going too short with this one led to something too concentrated and it was hard to identify the flavours for me. The bit of extra liquid helped seperate the flavour notes - again a similar palette of flavours to the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another super enjoyable Gesha coffee and another good showing from Brew Coffee Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we're looking at a 2020 release from Lewis Wright called &quot;The Colour of Intention&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/048-Colour-of-Intention/Colour-of-Intention.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis Wright is perhaps best known as being the vibraphone player in the UK jazz group &quot;Empirical&quot; - one of the more interesting UK jazz groups of the past few decades, playing music inspired by some of the free and avant garde artists as well as the more straight ahead. On &quot;The Colour of Intention&quot; however we get to see Wright in a more stripped down setting - he is joined by two fantastic musicians in the form of Matt Brewer on the bass (one of my favourite bassists) and Marcus Gilmore on the drums. With only a 2 piece rhythm section to support him we get to hear what Wright has to offer unencumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this outing there is less in the way of &quot;free&quot; playing than you'd expect if you came here via &quot;Empirical&quot; - the majority on the playing is fairly &quot;inside&quot;. The one notable exception being the opening track &quot;Mettle&quot; (embedded at the start of the blog) which evokes Bobby Hutcherson on Eric Dolphy's &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; recording with it's circular repeating melody.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpUY3zsGGXg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

What really stands out throughout the album is the sheer virtuosity of Wright. He has some really enviable chops, but does not let that get in the way of the music. You never get the impression that he is &quot;showing off&quot; or trying to impress anybody. This is particularly evident by the rather notable final track on the album: &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot;. For those unfamiliar: this is a piece by Thelonious Monk. It is known for being so complicated that the musicians on the recording (including Sonny Rollins) were unable to play it end to end without making mistakes, and to my knowledge Monk never performed this piece live in its entirety. By placing this track on an album you are certainly making a statement about your jazz chops. The arrangement is very cool too, it captures the vibe and the frequent tempo changes/rhythmic motifs but Wright manages to throw his own spin on the tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with playing a relatively obscure instrument such as the vibraphone is you instantly get compared to those that came before. These days most will get compared to the late great Gary Burton given his reinvention of the instrument. While Wright is clearly influence by Burton  (perhaps most notably on the track &quot;Resolve&quot; (above) which has a tinge of &quot;Crystal Silence&quot; to it.) Wright has his own sound and voice that is his own.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYb6L9KuTM8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Another track that really stands out for me is the beautiful &quot;Raise (For Z)&quot; (above) - it is not about high octane virtuosity at all and is the most stripped back on the album. I'm particularly fond of Brewer's arco playing which is simply stunning, Wright makes sure to hold back during these parts to allow Brewer the chance to shine. Overall the piece has a dream-like almost meditative feeling to it and offers a stark contrast to the more uptempo numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall &quot;The Colour of Intention&quot; is a really great modern jazz release. If you like small band interaction it is a shining example of what can be achieved. There is a near telepathic interplay between the trio and each one is trying to help the others thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

After a brief month hiatus the Plot Roasters ICON series subscription is back! Owing to Brexit related supply chain issues this coffee was due to be released in February but unfortunately got delayed until March. Let's see if good things do indeed come to those who wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder this is the 3rd installment of the ICON series by Plot Roasters. This series is a relatively expensive series of rare and exciting coffees, it's for those who love coffee and don't mind paying to get access to the rare lots. In this installment we have a Gesha varietal from Panama. In the past we've talked about the rise of the Gesha varietal in the mid 2000s - and those with a good memory will recall that a particular lot from a Panamanian farm was responsible for causing the &quot;boom&quot;. It is therefore always interesting to get hold of some Gesha from Panama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance the Gesha was grown by the Hartmann family - one of the leading names in coffee in Panama, and their coffees always command high prices and achieve enviable cupping scores. The Hartmann family has owned farmland in Panama since the early 1900s, it now consists of many different coffee growing plots. The coffee we're talking about today is from the &quot;Roscosa Montana&quot; plot which translates to &quot;Rocky Mountain&quot; which borders the Parque Nacional de La Amistad rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself has been naturally processed - dried on raised African beds for a full 25 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous ICON installments this arrives in 150g bags only. As a result I don't use it for espresso since after a couple of shots to dial in I'd be left with very little to enjoy at its best! So it's a filter only blog-post this week. I have been drinking a great espresso alongside this one but I'll feature it next time in a dedicated post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving nose first into the dry aroma: the first thing to note is it smells incredible. The main hit is from tropical fruits, notably papaya and mango. But along with that there are caramel notes and a good floral bouquet. You can tell this is a very complex coffee before even taking a sip. Although it's a natural process there is not a hint of funkiness however, it seems very clean for a natural coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving into the filter: this coffee is truly exquisite. The supply chain delays seem irrelevant on first sip - it is well worth the wait. The first wave of flavour that hits is the tropical fruit notes from the nose. Papaya and Mango are most prevalent but there is also a sharpness to it too, perhaps a passionfruit. But in the supporting cast I also noted down wild strawberries and I could even be argued into agreeing the sharpness has a raspberry quality. What is so interesting about this coffee however is that the floral notes stand up to these big tropical fruit notes - I get strong violet and lavendar vibes from this one. It is very very rare to find a coffee where the florals don't get overwhelmed by the bigger bolder flavours. This makes for a super interesting and complex cup. As the cup cools down the balance between the fruit and the floral changes, the cooler you go the more florals you pick up. This is a coffee that demands you to savour and watch the flavour profiles develop, drinking this in a temperature controlled ember mug would be an absolute travesty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again Plot have smashed it out of the park. Looking forward to see what is to come with future ICON releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side we're going to look at another icon: Wayne Shorter with his 1966 release &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/047-All-Seeing-Eye/All-Seeing-Eye.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Wayne Shorter is certainly one of the elder-statesmen of jazz. Nearing in on his 90th birthday he has a career spanning around 70 years. During that time we has released solo works, been a member of both Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (with whom he became the primary composer for the band) and Miles Davis' band - along with being a founding member of one of the greatest fusion groups of all time in Weather Report. &quot;Star studded career&quot; isn't nearly enough to describe what Shorter has achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very start of his career Shorter was seen as &quot;just another Coltrane tribute act&quot; - a label that (rather unfairly) was attributed to many tenor players of that era. As his career developed it was clear Wayne was anything but. Instead of relying on flashy, complicated, virtuosic playing (although he certainly had chops) - Shorter is now best known for his compositional voice. You can argue that he is one the greatest composers in all of jazz, if not all of music. His compostional style is focussed heavily on harmony, and using this to create a &quot;mood&quot;. A few albums before &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; he released perhaps his most famous album &quot;Speak No Evil&quot; where he explores the modal jazz style. Although his later works can't really be considered &quot;modal&quot; in the same way you can tell the modal style of creating a mood for a piece stuck with Shorter.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylc6_wPm6SA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; marks Wayne's 9th solo outing, and to date his most ambitious. From the get-go it is clear this is not your run of the mill bop record but something new entirely. It makes some nods from the avant-garde and free movements but the compositions are much more structured than is often the case in those styles. It is a highly ambitious record that still sounds daring today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening title track (embedded at the start of this post) sets the tone for the rest of the record. In interviews Wayne has stated the entire album is an attempt to depict the meaning of life, creation and the nature of god. The solos on the title track thus represent &quot;the machinery involved in the process of creation&quot; - with other tracks on the album showing similar levels of symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most &quot;traditional&quot; bop-sounding track on the album is &quot;Chaos&quot; (above) - living up to its name it's a chaotic fire-breathing sort of piece which allows the stellar cast to flex their chops. The supporting cast on the album features: Freddie Hubbard on trumpet/flugelhorn, Grachan Moncur III on trombone, James Spaulding on alto, Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass and Joe Chambers on drums (with a cameo from Wayne's brother Alan on one piece). This is an enviable line-up of talent and the quality shows throughout, although the music is highly daring and experimental it never feels out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; represents one of my favourite Wayne Shorter albums and it is well worth your time. It is likely music you'll have to put the effort in to appreciate however, and it commands your attention. But it is an album that will reward your effort so it's worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are welcoming a new coffee roaster to the blog: Brew Coffee Plus. Located in Streatham, South London - these guys have been on my radar for a while but I haven't got round to trying them. They tick a few boxes for things I typically look for in a roaster: a concise offering, focusing on quality over quantity. Plus their packaging is attractive but simple. You can read more about them on their website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://brewcoffeeplus.com/&quot;&gt;https://brewcoffeeplus.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I opted for one of their Colombian offerings - Villa Betvlia - a Caturra microlot that has been naturally processed. The farm is located in Huila, a &quot;hotspot&quot; for coffee within the country. The bag/website does not offer much in the way of back story behind this coffee, fitting with Brew Plus Coffee's minimalist aesthetic, so I don't really know much more about this coffee. So I guess we should just dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the nose the first thing that hits you is big juicy tropical fruits. It is not a really intense &quot;fruit bomb&quot; aroma but more like a very nice tropical fruit salad. Although the tropical fruits hint towards natural processing methods you do not get the boozy/funky natural notes you often get. I also notice a caramel note in the supporting cast. Very appetising. In terms of roast level we are in a light range, but it is not super light/nordic by any means - not quite medium-light but getting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving swiftly onto the filter: again the over-arching flavour notes are tropical fruits. I get mango and pineapple most of all - the sweeter end of the tropical fruit range. There is also the passion fruit type acidity to matters but primarily I would say this is on the sweeter end rather than the acidic end. If you imagine a tropical fruit salad covered in a sugar-syrup you wouldn't be far off. The body and mouthfeel are in the medium sort of range, it is not completely absent but neither is it a coffee you need to chew. The aftertaste is fairly intense and lingering. Temperature wise I find this coffee is fairly linear - it has the same character hotter or cooler so it's one you can drink at your leisure. Overall it is not hugely complex but is certainly very drinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an espresso this might be one of the easiest coffees to dial in I've experienced. It can take pretty much whatever I threw at it in terms of recipe. In the end I found that I liked a 1:2.1 ratio with a 7s pre-infuse followed with a 32-34s pull - on the temperature scale I'm medium-high. This is not normally how I like to pull shots as it can introduce some bitterness or astringency to the finish but this is a coffee that can take it. You're rewarded with a thicker more luxurious shot and more intensity compared to my more usual longer/quicker style of pull. Again the tropical fruit salad and sugary sweetness comes through in the espresso, the acidity is slightly more noticable in the espresso but it is still a sweet coffee first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall a very enjoyable coffee, hopefully a sign of things to come from this roaster and one I'm sure I'll be heading back to based on this showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our jazz record this week we are heading back to 1973 and guitarist George Benson with his release: &quot;Body Talk&quot; on CTI records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/046-Body-Talk/Body-Talk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are new to the world of jazz you might be surprised to see George Benson recommended on a jazz-blog. For many he will be synonymous with pop records such as &quot;Give Me The Night&quot; or his &quot;crooner&quot; image from his later works. It is easy to forget he has some serious jazz under his belt also. When he burst onto the scene in the 1960s he was considered a protege to Wes Montgomery in some respects. George's &quot;twin careers&quot; of jazz star and pop star came to a head a few years ago at a gig in London whereby he was unable to sing so played a set of instrumental jazz pieces and the (non-jazz) crowd booed him for not playing his &quot;hits&quot; - a rather embarrassing incident for the London live music scene and those involved should be ashamed.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HV1Tfj8qqtI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;Body Talk&quot; is one of my favourite Benson albums. It marks a kind of &quot;cross-over&quot; period from the more straight ahead jazz he was playing before and the RnB and pop influenced music that came after. I wish he spent a bit more time exploring this soul-jazz kind of space as he was very good at it. On this album Benson entrusted James Brown alumni - saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis to write and arrange a few of the tunes. But it is clear that the James Brown DNA heavily influenced Benson at the time since all the tracks feature the strong grooves we associate with Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album also features some heavyweight jazz icons in the supporting cast: Jack DeJohnette taking control of the drumming duties - one of the most prolific jazz drummers of all time. Jack manages to introduce a slight swing to proceedings while keeping the muscular grooves driving forward, something that is not easy to do by any means. Alongside is Ron Carter on the acoustic bass (the album also features Gary King on electric bass). We've spoken about Ron in the blog before, as a bass player he is completely reliable and can throw his hand at anything - another jazz legend. On the electric piano we also have Harold Mabern. He is one of the underappreciated greats, a lot of his work has been as a sideman rather than a leader. I was fortunate enough to be able to meet him before he passed away - a great musician and a great person. I'll save my Harold story for another day when we can focus on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off with &quot;Dance&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) and straight away gets into a deep groove. You can tell that Benson had an eye on making music you can move to here, it's almost impossible to not tap your foot along to the beat. However, it features an absolutely virtuousic guitar performance throughout. I consider Benson as one of the most naturally gifted guitar players of all time. There appears to be absolutely no filter between brain and guitar, it comes across as completely effortless. This is backed up by watching some of his incomprehensible guitar tuition videos - it is so natural he is completely unable to effectively explain what he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another track that is particularly interesting on the album is the third number: &quot;Plum&quot; (above). This really exemplifies the two worlds of jazz and RnB that Benson is trying to straddle. It starts off in a swinging jazz tune but eventually the horns and percussion come in, the groove hits and we're comfortably in foot-tapping mode again. This is not a jarring experience of slamming two styles together - the transition is seamless. Again Benson throws out some mindblowing guitar lines as all this is unfolding.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

Perhaps the hardest hitting groove is the title track &quot;Body Talk&quot; (above). Here we have a piece that is part James Brown groove and part Latin jazz. It's 8 minutes of pure energy and intensity. While there is incredible musicianship on display, the main theme is itself catchy and something you'll likely be humming to yourself after hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Body Talk&quot; is a bit of an underappreciated jazz album, from his &quot;jazz&quot; period other Benson albums such as &quot;Beyond Blue Horizon&quot; often get more publicity - but for me &quot;Body Talk&quot; is where Benson hits his stride. If you do not know anything of George Benson's jazz career I'd strongly suggest giving it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we're heading back to Plot Coffee Roasting again. A few blog posts ago we featured the rather special Champagne yeast processed coffee from Finca La Senda in Guatemala - this time we feature another experimental processed coffee from the very same farm. As before the coffee is of the Pache varietal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is described as a &quot;hydro-natrual&quot; - the cherries are picked and dried in the sun for 4 days before being soaked in water overnight. This &quot;rehydrates&quot; the cherries which are then dried in the shade for another 28-30 days. The folks at Finca La Senda are certainly experimental and they should be commended for it. I think processing variation is likely to be the key to unlocking new flavour potential in coffee. Of course genetic diversity of coffee plants can lead to variation but this is a slow process driven by evolution (aside from the rare &quot;freak discovery&quot; of an unknown varietal) - processing is something that has a shorter feedback loop and so is a more commercially viable for the farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit however I'm not a fan of all the experimental processings I've had. In fact I have a rather low hit rate of enjoyment from them, I often find them unbalanced or just plain odd. Based on the Champagne yeast processed coffee I have high hopes for this one however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets just dive straight into the coffee itself. Like the Champagne yeast offering Plot have opted for a pretty light roast, maybe a hair darker than the Champagne yeast but I never compared them side by side. On the dry aroma it is clear this is a very different beast. The first thing that I notice is the red berry note - it also has a sort of bramble note too, it reminds me of a fruit picking farm. In the background there is just a hint of tropical fruit, but it is not your typical &quot;fruit bomb&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual we start with a filter brew: just as on the nose the primary thing I notice is the red berry flavours. The label lists blueberry and raspberry, which I don't disagree with. The tropical fruit flavours are also more prominent in the cup, mango being the predominant note. On the acidity scale this one comes in quite high but it is balanced with a lot of sweetness. It also has quite a big mouthfeel and body. Interestingly I find this coffee is better at higher cup temperatures, usually I find the flavours difficult to distinguish at the higher temperatures but this coffee keeps its clarity. At lower cup temperatures the acidity can take over a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto espresso: as you'd expect for a light roast the machine temp is set to maximum. For a ratio I found 1:2.5 works best but I prefered to pull a bit slower than usual at around 30-32s. This allowed more of the body to come through and added some intensity to the shot. I didn't find this added any bitterness at all and everything balanced nicely. The flavour profile was much the same as the filter brew: mangos and raspberries. Despite being a fairly acidic light roast it is surprisingly easy to drink as an espresso and one I have enjoyed. The only downside to the espresso compared to the filter is less of the complexity comes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall another great offering. For me the Champagne yeast version was more up my street, but I could easily see others having the opposite preference. Drinking two coffees from the same farm with different processings is always interesting as you can see what a huge difference there is in the cup. These coffees are night and day different, in a blind tasting I don't think I'd be able to identify they were from the same farm. Plot offer a third processing from Finca La Senda (carbonic maceration) but unfortunately at the time I couldn't justify getting all three since I already had too much coffee to be getting on with. If it's still available next time I do a Plot order I'll pick up a bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we're heading back to an all time classic from 1957. The seminal &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; from Dizzy Gillespie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/045-Sonny-Side-Up/Sonny-Side-Up.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dizzy has featured on the blog in the past as a co-headliner but this is his first showing in his own right. Dizzy of course needs no introduction - one of the forefathers of be-bop, he is one of the few jazz artists who became known outside of the jazz community. Potentially down to his look: often sporting a beret, horn-rimmed glasses and of course the puffed out cheeks when playing. Or possibly down to his jovial and light hearted personality. But, there is no doubting his musical pedigree.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rezdck_Roog&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

By 1957 be-bop had pretty much run its course, it had become fairly &quot;mainstream&quot; in jazz by then so just playing be-bop was not enough to gain recognition. Jazz artists were beginning to look at the new &quot;post-bop&quot; world and where they could make their mark. For somebody like Dizzy who was one of the originators this could present a problem, it is often easy for an artist to get stuck in their stylistic box and unable to adapt with the times. To combat this Dizzy apointed two tenor saxophonists to help him out: Sonny Stitt and Sonny Rollins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides just providing am easy pun for the album's title the tenor pair provided the necessary artistic direction for the album. Both Sonny's were clearly disciples of Gillespie's buddy Charlie Parker - but instead of simply copying Bird licks they each developed upon the Parker framework in different ways. Stitt was most directly compared to Parker, originally playing alto he was often labelled a &quot;Parker Clone&quot;. To combat this he made the switch to the tenor and developed a more forceful approach, however he still adopted the belly-fire of Parker and made use of the wild lines we associate with be-bop. In contrast Rollins adapted the Parker ethos in a different way, he made use of the be-bop framework but explored thematic and motif led ideas. You could argue it is more of an intellectual approach, often adopting more complex harmonic devices and crafting lines that fall further from typical be-bop. Hearing the two tenor-men back-to-back is part of the joy of this album. You could never mistake one for the other since their styles are so different (although I believe one version of the liner notes did just that, stating that a Rollins solo appears first or vice versa) Yet both players serve the music being played and neither sounds out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With three titans in Gillespie, Rollins and Stitt - it would be easy to overlook the rest of the band: Ray Bryant on piano, Tommy Bryant on bass and Charlie Persip on drums. While these guys may not be &quot;headline acts&quot; as the others they do add to the quality of the album - so many albums featuring &quot;heavyweights&quot; fall down with poor supporting casts. This is particularly true for an album such as &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; where you have two tenor players battling each other for supremacy, the rhythm section needs to be tight and stay out of their way and that is certainly achieved here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; is afterall however a Dizzy Gillespie album so it is worth exploring a little bit of his role. The album is itself essentially a &quot;live&quot; studio album, all tracks were recorded in one take in a &quot;cutting session&quot; style. Reportedly before the date Dizzy did his best to rile up the rivalry between the Sonny's - important work to get the best out of the band. This all came to a head in the stand out tenor-duel on the track &quot;Eternal Triangle&quot;. For me this is Dizzy Gillespie's true talent: getting the best out of people. I do not believe Charlie Parker would have been nearly as revered as he is today without Gillespie. Dizzy worked out a lot of the harmonic complexities of be-bop which allowed Parker (and to a lesser extent Monk) to flourish.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8afBciyvAeA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Dizzy is of course no slouch on the trumpet either, this is particularly clear on his killer solo on &quot;After Hours&quot;. He manages to pull of an effortlessly cool and laidback blues led solo. Not something you instantly think of when you think of a Dizzy solo. Then of course you cannot ignore the trademark Gillespie humour and wit - on this album coming through in the opening track &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;. Here Gillespie completely reworks the standard both melodically and rhythmically to create a fresh take on a well-trodden classic. We also get to hear Dizzy stretch his vocal chords which is always intresting too. I can see many parallels between his vocal phrasing on this tune and the phrasing used in rap music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to this album is its brevity - clocking in at just over 30 minutes. It would have been great to have another cut or two on the album but it doesen't take away from the enjoyment. For the jazz historians and those interested in the progression of be-bop it is a very interesting recording, but it is also a great listen for those that just want to hear a great old-fashioned cutting session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
