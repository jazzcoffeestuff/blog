&lt;/center&gt;

This week we are heading back to a roaster who has appeared on the blog before: Curve Coffee Roasters located in Margate. The guys and girls at Curve really know what they're doing and I've not been disappointed from them in the past. I was, therefore, very much looking forward to this coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the washed Ethiopian coffees have started to become available it comes as no surprise that this coffee is another washed Ethiopian. These are the coffees that really get me excited and given a choice what I would choose at least 90% of the time. I don't have a huge amount of information about this coffee, I know that it has undergone a dry fermentation process, the cultivars are &quot;heirloom&quot; and it is produced my a collection of small-holder farmers located in the Bombe Mountains within the Sidama region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado let's dive into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma you get everything you would expect from a coffee from this region. You're greeted with a big hit of peach and stone fruits along with the usual jasmine florals. Alongside this is a sweet honey type note to pull everything together. The aromas are punchier than you might ordinarily expect from a washed Ethiopian coffee but you could hardly describe it as a heavy hitter. It's the sort of aroma that makes you want to start brewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual we'll start by looking at the coffee as a filter. I usually find this is the best way to judge a coffee (at least compared to espresso) since the technique is not too demanding - although the forum, discord, YouTube and Insta coffee communities do enjoy making things more complicated than need be. In the cup I would describe this as quite a &quot;soft&quot; coffee, it is not one that will demand your attention and it is very balanced so you don't get distracted by it. It's the sort of cup that can fit into your day: if you want to sit and appreciate flavours you can, but if you don't want to that's cool too. The flavour profile itself is the same as on the dry aroma: peaches, florals and honey. The flavour leans heavily towards the peach and stone fruit end of things, the florals are there but they're not &quot;in your face&quot;. This is a cup that improves as it cools (up to a point) in my experience, so try to hold off slurping it down in a few seconds - although that does take some restraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto all things espresso: this one is fairly forgiving on grind size and recipe, as long as you don't do a super slow pull things should be tasty. I find 1:2.5 is about right and I look for around 7s pre-infuse then a 24s pull. What you're left with is concentrated peach juice sweetened with some honey. The body and mouthfeel is not very big no matter what you do so pulling a little longer than a standard 1:2 allows for a bit more flavour separation which is a good compromise in my book. The aftertaste is extremely clean and not long lived, it makes Bombe very easy to shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes as no surprise that Curve did a good job roasting this coffee, and it's another solid washed Ethiopian. It seems like the washed Ethiopians are very strong this season (although it might be I have just been waiting for so long). I'm sure Curve will feature on the blog again and I'm certain this won't be the last from Ethiopia we'll see this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week I found myself digging out an album from 2014: Jeff Ballard Trio's &quot;Time's Tales&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/072-Times-Tales/Times-Tales.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Ballard may not be a name you are instantly familiar with. However, if you have any familiarity with jazz you have likely heard his playing before. As a side-man he has appeared on albums from Chick Corea, Joshua Redman, Pat Metheny and Kurt Rosenwinkel. He is probably most famous for being the long-term drummer in the Brad Mehldau trio, having been appointed to that position in 2005. Given the popularity of these artists he is likely one of the most successful modern drummers based on album sales (although I have not crunched any numbers for this).

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/flPQcl5XZXc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The Jeff Ballard Trio consists of Jeff Ballard on drums (unsurpirsingly), Lionel Loueke on electric guitars and Miguel Zenon on alto saxophone. Lionel Loueke is one of the more interesting modern jazz guitarists around, he takes a lot of his influence from West African music and combines this with Xhosa-inspired vocal lines using the &quot;click&quot; sounds in a similar way to the &quot;scat&quot; sounds more familiar to jazz listeners. Miguel Zenon is no slouch either, it is safe to say he is firmly in the &quot;free&quot; camp in terms of jazz and has a strong influence of Ornette Coleman in his playing. Perhaps most notable within his playing is his ability to play complex polyrhythmic ideas with ease. The Jeff Ballard Trio is therefore a heavy hitting modern jazz trio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Time's Tales&quot; is really quite an ambitious album. It covers a lot of ground and styles from simple ballads, to heavy rock fusion, to world music and free jazz. The musicians make these transitions seamless and the whole album remains coherent and not just a big mess of tunes thrown together. Jeff's drum lines and ability to swing through even the most complicated rhythmic signatures is what really holds the whole thing together. Without having a bassist to lean back on the trio relies on the drummer to keep them grounded, but in &quot;Time's Tales&quot; case this doesn't equate to &quot;boring, safe&quot; drumming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of the album is the track &quot;Beat Street&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). It kicks off with a twisting melody played by Zenon and Loueke in unison on top of a complicated meter. This quickly gives way to Zenon's solo which showcases his Coleman inspired free lines. This leads into Loueke's solo which takes influence from world music before Ballard gives a polyrhythmic masterclass in his solo. The magic of the piece is hearing how all three musicians stay true to their individual styles and preferences yet still serve the tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next tune I want to highlight is &quot;Hanging Tree&quot; (above). The influence here is clearly &quot;rock&quot; music and it features Loueke playing distorted guitar in a way I've not heard him play before. This is a tune that could easily be considered &quot;fusion&quot; or even &quot;jazz-punk&quot;. On the album it is a bit of an outlier which makes it all the more memorable. It also gives Ballard a chance to play with more aggression which increases the energy and adds a nice flow to the track listing.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yOhfEkx8D4M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Another personal highlight of mine is Zenon's arrangement of Silvio Rodriguez's &quot;El Reparador de Suenos&quot; (above). Rooted firmly in the Afro-Cuban tradition the track swings with syncopated style and elegance. Here Zenon and Loueke do not opt to play in unison but play contrasting lines that seem to fit perfectly. The interplay between all members is an absolute pleasure to hear, Ballard's drumming pushes and pulls throughout creating tension only to release it at the optimal point. It is a very refreshing take on the Afro-Cuban style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I selected 3 tracks here I could have equally selected any of the others to feature. The Gershwin ballad &quot;The Man I Love&quot; is simply sublime as is the take on Bela Bartok's &quot;Dal&quot;. The improv pieces &quot;Free 1&quot; and &quot;Free 3&quot; are also worthy of note as is the Loueke penned &quot;Virgin Forest&quot;. If I were to write this blog on another day I could have easily featured a completely different set of tracks. As is the strength of this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Time's Tales&quot; is unlikely to feature in any &quot;essential listening&quot; album list you'll ever find, but it is still worthy of your time if it is one that is unfamiliar to you. It is a great example of what a modern jazz trio can do, it takes influence from the past but is not beholden to it. I consider this album a bit of an &quot;underrated gem&quot; from the mid 2010s, so be sure to hunt down a copy if you like what you've heard/read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

For the coffee this week we are heading back to Bath's finest: Round Hill Roastery. These guys have appeared on the blog many times in the past and rarely disappoint, they're one of the roasters I always find myself going back to because they're so reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this coffee arrived I had a bit of a glut of coffee to get through, so this coffee has been sitting in my freezer for a good few weeks. Typically I don't like freezing coffee and I like to keep a rolling supply going rather than keep a large freezer back log. This is largely down to superstition. When I first got into specialty coffee many moons ago all the advice said &quot;never freeze coffee&quot; and so this has kind of stuck with me. We know better now however, and plenty of people get amazing results from freezing. In the back of my mind I'm always worried about trapped humidity etc. in the bag causing issues. Fortunately with this weeks coffee I did not see any ill effects (although I didn't try a &quot;non-freezed&quot; version to compare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself is from a farm called La Claudina in Colombia. This particular lot consists of Colombia and Caturra cultivars and what makes the coffee particularly interesting is the &quot;extended fermentation&quot; processing. The coffee cherries ferment in water for 24 hours and then dry ferment for 24 hours. This farm adjusts these processing methods on different lots to achieve different results. This particular example has been &quot;extended&quot; compared to their usual approach, so I am expecting a bit of a funky vibe to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I get notes of rich caramels and sweet dark berries. It does not give off an obvious &quot;funk&quot; note but you can tell it's got a &quot;natural&quot; thing going on. On the nose it is fairly punchy but is not a complete fruit-bomb sort of coffee. It is certainly inviting, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a filter brewed in the usual way: the funky note is quite apparent. This may be because I don't typically take the funky bus often. It doesn't have the real farm-yard natural funk that some have, but it is noticable. I would describe it more as a fermented fruit sort of funk instead of a boozy funk. In terms of flavour notes the dark berry notes from the nose are certainly at the forefront for me. Alongside is a little tropical fruit edge and just a hint of herbaceous florality. In terms of profile I would say the acidity and sweetness are medium and the body is fairly high. The cup is quite &quot;linear&quot; as it cools, so you don't get too many surprises. The aftertaste is quite longlasting but pleasant. For a natural this funky it is not a muddy sludgefest, there is still a decent amount of clarity (but nothing like the washed Ethiopian's of the past couple of weeks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coffee for me is more at home as an espresso (as always I still only buy the filter roast option). The bigger body and heavier dark fruit notes are more at home in the concentrated form. The funkiness in the filter is somewhat lost as an espresso however. After a bit of playing I settled on a ratio of 1:2.25. This seemed to highlight the body and mouthfeel while being just long enough for good flavour separation. As an espresso it is one you do not really have to think about, it is extremely easy to pull and extremely easy to drink. The flavour profile is much the same as in the filter but in concentrated form you also get a sort of jammy quality too, it is a slightly &quot;sticky&quot; sort of mouthfeel which is quite nice. If you think of redcurrant jelly as you'd have on a roast dinner it's not a million miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected Round Hill delivered the goods again and show just how reliable they are as a roaster. I'm sure it won't be too long until they feature on the blog once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the jazz side this week I found myself listening to a 2020 release that slipped my attention: Wayne Escoffery's &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; on the Smoke Sessions label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/071-Humble-Warrior/Humble-Warrior.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit I dropped the ball on this one, I should have checked this out months ago. I love some of the music being put out on the Smoke Sessions label but I find it hard to remember individual albums because they all have near identical cover art. As a result I create fake memories of hearing a particular album because I mistake it for another. Thankfully I managed to notice my error with &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot;.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mt7tQphDzhQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Wayne is perhaps best known for his work with the Mingus Big Band (with whom he won a Grammy) but he has an equally impressive resume playing with the likes of Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Jimmy Cobb and Monty Alexander among others. He is also a long standing member of the Tom Harrell quintet. He also holds the prestigious position &quot;lecturer of jazz improvisation&quot; at Yale. Under his own name he has half a dozon or so albums, and his previous release &quot;Vortex&quot; from 2018 won him a lot of plaudits cementing him as one of the pre-eminent saxophonists working today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; features Wayne's usual quartet along with a couple of interesting guest spots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wayne Escoffery: Saxophone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Kikoski: Piano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ugonna Okegwo: Bass &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ralph Peterson: Drums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Randy Brecker: Trumpet &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Gilmore: Guitar &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can feel the sense of familiarity between the core band throughout the album. Wayne seems to place a high level of trust in his musicians and it feels more like a group collaborative effort than a band playing the leaders compositions. This shows a lot of maturity as a band leader and the music benefits from it. Kikoski and Okegwo each even get a writing credit for the tracks &quot;Undefined&quot; and &quot;Back to Square One&quot; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album gets its title as a tribute to the many jazz greats we have lost in recent years: musicians who acted like warriors yet allowed the music to keep them humble. As quite a softly spoken character himself, it feels as though this is also a good way to describe Wayne Escoffery. But make no mistake: once the music starts he is capable of creating some of the most intense and complex fire breathing solos around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; is dedicated to a jazz re-interpretation of Benjamin Britten's &quot;Missa Brevis In D&quot; - and this is perhaps the major statement on the album. It is expertly crafted, it takes just enough liberties to be interesting but it does not apply so many re-harmonizations that the piece itself becomes unrecognizable. This is a difficult line to draw and one where many jazz musicians fail in interpreting classical pieces. As a young child Escoffery was a member of a boys choir, and given the popularity of &quot;Missa Brevis in D&quot; with choirs, this is likely where the inspiration came from. One of the standout moments of this re-interpretation is in &quot;Benedictus&quot; where Wayne's son Vaughn Escoffery (11 years old) adds vocals to double his father's sax lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the two Escoffery original compositions the title track gives the comtemplative and respectful quality one would expect knowing the back story. It features quite a complex twisting melody featuring some breathtaking interplay between Escoffery and Brecker. It manages to shock and amaze but at the same time remain entirely approachable, marking Escoffery as a &quot;Humble Warrior&quot; indeed. Of course the track also acts as a fantastic &quot;canvas&quot; for the soloists, with Escoffery building from tasteful almost vocal lines through to full frenetic madness but always staying in total control.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YosT9Zs_80k&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Another standout track for me is Gildo Mahones' ballad: &quot;Quarter Moon&quot;. On this Wayne shows he does not need to rely on his awe inspiring technique and harmonic knowledge to get the job done. He can play a sensitive and caring ballad as well as anybody, something that is becoming a bit of a lost art in modern jazz. I have to admit that &quot;Quarter Moon&quot; was not a piece I was familiar with before listening to this album, but it has become a firm favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; is a great example of what modern jazz can be. It is one I've had on solid rotation for the past week or so. If you're looking for something new to listen to that is complex yet approachable, respects jazz of the past but still makes a statement itself - you should really hunt down a copy of &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; as it's a thoroughly enjoyable listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we head back to the fine folks at Plot coffee roasting, I always seem to be raving about them on this blog but they continue to knock it out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I have talked about how much I enjoy washed Ethiopian coffees, if I see one on a cafe's bean selection it will take something special to draw me away from trying it. We are now heading into the part of the year when all the washed Ethiopian coffees are starting to land, I believe this was actually the inspiration for the Andy Williams song: &quot;It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year&quot; (citation needed). This brings a lot of excitement to JazzCoffeeStuffHQ but also lots of headaches in trying to decide which ones I want to buy and from which roasters. Plot is sort of a no brainer option to kick off the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular coffee is from a washing station owned by Israel Degfa - an inpsiring man who does a lot of amazing work for the community in Ethiopia, we have talked about him at length in previous posts so we won't re-tread the same ground here. The location of the washing station is in Hambella Dhekbor within the Guji zone of the Oromia region. Each region/zone of Ethiopia has its own &quot;flavour profile&quot; so those more familiar with Ethiopian coffee might know what to expect from a washed Guji. The cultivars for this coffee have not been identified and are simply listed as &quot;landrace varieties&quot;, it would have been nice to get some more detail but this is not always possible. For those who worry about altitude of the area is at 1850-2200 MASL - so certainly on the higher end!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not waste any more time and get straight into the coffee itself. On the dry aroma I don't get a particularly intense bouquet. As you would expect on the nose it is quite delicate and restrained but with a lot of floral complexity. It is quite hard to pick out individual notes because the aroma is so feint. As I've said before I don't believe a &quot;weak nose&quot; means &quot;weak in the cup&quot;, I think it's a false equivalency many new to coffee make. I think the reverse might actually be true, the more volatiles given off leave less to be in the bean to be extracted - but this is just my supposition, I have no evidence to back this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going in as a filter: the first sip I had made me sit back and take note. This is a very striking coffee, it is vibrant, zingy, sparkly, clean and extremely tasty. It also has a boat load of complexity and really changes character through the lifetime of the cup. The main flavour notes I get are a really crisp dry lemonade, green apples, lime along with a ton of floral character in the back: lavendar, jasmine and violet. The peach or apricot note you often get is a little overpowered by the heavier acidic fruit flavours here and it doesn't have a strong black-tea note like some. This makes it quite a neat take on a washed Guji and keeps it very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an espresso I've found this one is really quite forgiving on my set-up. I ultimately settle for 1:2.5 in around 25s which is a fairly typical recipe for me, I generally start there but with this one I found no reason to experiment any further. Unlike some floral coffees the floral notes are still at the forefront in the concentrated form, this makes for one of the more complex espresso shots you're likely to taste. Based on the acidity in the filter one might expect the espresso to be prone to &quot;battery acid&quot; but this is really not the case, it is certainly a crisp acidic espresso but it was not once overbearing. It is not likely to be a shot for those chasing the big bodied chewy traditional espresso styles but I think it is one that can appeal to those starting to stray into the more acidic lighter roast realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all another knock out by Plot (not that I'd expect anything less). These sorts of coffees are really my favourites, I love tasting the &quot;unobtainium&quot; hyper-coffees with crazy processing and cultivars: but there's something special about finding really tasty coffees at reasonable enough prices. If I operated a cafe I would be very happy to make this one my &quot;house&quot; option while it is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the washed Ethiopian coffee season: another event that adds an air of excitement to the JazzCoffeeStuffHQ is a new album from Kenny Garrett. This is what we're going to take a look at today: &quot;Sounds From The Ancestors&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/070-Ancestors/Ancestors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This album was released yesterday, so this blog will very much just be my initial impressions rather than any deep takes on the pieces. I've done this with a couple of albums in the past, at one point I might go back and do a retrospective to compare my initial thoughts to how I feel after more serious listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny has featured on the blog previously so if you'd like more a background on him there's a good place to go. For my money Kenny is the most reliable jazz performer in the world today. His live shows are simply fantastic, he doesn't have a huge &quot;stage persona&quot;, he doesn't relay stories or jokes to the crowd, he doesn't use light shows or expansive backdrops and he doesn't ham it up with over-exaggerated mannerisms to elicit a response from the crowd. Instead he just gets to work, serves the music and has the audience eating out of the palm of his hand. If you have not had a chance to go to one of his shows I strongly suggest going.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

So let's get into &quot;Sounds From The Ancestors&quot; a bit. As the name suggests the whole album feels a bit like a nod to those that came before him. If you have heard an album from Kenny in the past decade or so you'll know he has been taking more and more of an influence from &quot;non-jazz&quot; music (but make no mistake he is still a jazz heavyweight). This is noticable on the album, you have influences from hip-hop, afro-cuban jazz, Asian classical music, soul/rnb along with a whole host of other jazz influences. My ear is quite attuned to the melodic minor scales that make up a large part of Kenny's playing (he loves the Mix flat 6 in particular over dominant chords), but I see him playing more and more with what I believe is the Hirajoshi or &quot;Japanese Pentatonic&quot; scale in his later work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This album is also noticable for the inclusion of vocalists, something Kenny hasn't really used too much in the past (aside from the odd piece or the throat singing on &quot;Pushing the World Away&quot;). The vocalists don't really sing &quot;songs&quot; however, the voices are used as additional instruments in the arrangement. They are often doubling lines or providing additional harmony to extend the depth of the mix. I can imagine live this will lead to a lot of audience interaction with Kenny essentially playing the audience as a &quot;piano&quot; of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also fantastic to hear Kenny further expand rhythmically (the tracks contain tributes to legendary jazz drummers Art Blakey and Tony Allen). On the last few albums he began to dip his toe into poly-rhythms but he has taken this much further. This is perhaps most noticable on &quot;For Art's Sake&quot; where the drum and percussion players lay down a really complex but grooving meter. There is a really mind blowing section of poly-rhythm which I believe is something in 6 played over something in 7, but I'll need to listen to this more to get my ear in and really nail down what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the stand-out pieces for me is the second track &quot;Hargrove&quot; (clearly a tribute to late trumpeter Roy Hargrove). He captures the vibe of the jazz-hip-hop crossover that characterised the Hargrove sound, however he still manages to inject the Garrett sound. I believe this track could act as an incredibly powerful &quot;gateway drug&quot; for those in the neo-soul and jazz-hip-hop scene looking to start their journey into the heavier end of jazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track &quot;It's Time to Come Home&quot; captures the afro-cuban side to Kenny's playing perfectly. It feels like a modern update to the sound of another great Kenny: Dorham. For the hardcore Garrett fans it also features some cool little throwback licks to older pieces in his repertoire.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

Overall &quot;Sounds From The Ancestors&quot; is incredibly complex, exciting and even to this day Kenny is pushing into new ground. Despite all the complexity (you can really spend an age trying to work out what's going on with some of these pieces) it is surprisingly approachable and you don't require a music degree to enjoy the music (something that can't be said for some modern jazz). I feel this is an album worthy of the hype and I'm sure it's one I'll keep coming back to, but this is hardly a surprise from a Kenny Garrett album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we take a look at the August edition of the KaffeBox subscription. This month the featured roaster is Solberg &amp;amp; Hansen located in Oslo, Norway. What makes Solberg &amp;amp; Hansen particularly interesting is they were established in 1879 - which in itself is quite remarkable. Most of the roasters featured on this blog were only established in the 2000s (with possibly one or two creeping into the 90s). This makes Solberg &amp;amp; Hansen the oldest coffee roaster in Norway and one of the oldest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only previous experience with Solberg &amp;amp; Hansen has been from another coffee subscription I have for decaf coffee, and that one was probably a top 5 decaf of all time for me. So I have high hopes for the coffee this week. Unlike in previous KaffeBox offerings we only have one coffee supplied in a 250g bag this time, which means we can really dig into it as both a filter and an espresso. Which makes a change from the previous KaffeBox &quot;split&quot; blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself is called Chelbesa, grown in Gedeo, Gedeb in Ethiopia. The coffee is processed at the Danche washing station. The coffee has undergone a 72 hour wet fermentation before beging washed and then soaked for a further 2 hours and dried over the course of 10 days. Unlike many Ethiopian coffees the cultivars have been identified as consisting of Wolicho and Kurume - this is a trend I am very in favour of and hope it becomes common practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Chelbesa is a coffee I have had a few times before from other roasters so I have a good idea of what to expect in the cup. Fortunately it is a coffee that I have enjoyed in the past so one I am looking forward to trying again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the dry aroma I get the usual floral and stone fruit notes you associate with a washed Ethiopian coffee like this, however I also get lots of caramel and toffee notes too. I believe this is due to the coffee being a little more developed than you'd typically expect from a Nordic roaster. You can tell this is a more &quot;traditional&quot; roaster compared to some of the &quot;new kids on the block&quot; and there is nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a filter Chelbesa is very similar to how I remember it. I would describe the coffee as very &quot;soft&quot;, I can't really think of a better word to use. While some Ethiopian coffees are vibrant, others are very perfumed, Chelbesa has a soft almost marshmallow quality to it. This is more a textural or sensory experience than it is a taste thing. In terms of flavours you have all the usual suspects coming to play: peaches, apricots, jasmine, floral, black tea - everything you want in a washed Ethiopian. It does not have much in the way of citrus like some however. It is a complex cup that really changes with temperature and it's one you can drink almost to the point of being &quot;cold&quot; and it doesn't become too harsh. It is relatively low in acidity (for an Ethiopian) and fairly sweet with a good amount of body. I wouldn't describe it as a &quot;typical washed Ethiopian&quot; but it is a nice twist on a theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an espresso there are a few things to note. The first of which is that owing to the &quot;soft&quot; and restrained quality of the coffee you can pull really concentrated shots without things getting harsh or muddled. The slightly more developed roast helps in this regard too as it makes it incredibly easy to extract. I stuck to the tradtional 1:2 with about 7s pre-infuse then a 27s pull with this one. It's not often I use a recipe like this. I did bump the temperature up a little bit which did seem to add a touch more vibrancy to the cup. The flavour profile is much like the filter: peaches, apricots, black tea and plenty of florals. If you imagine a sweet peach iced tea that you reduced down to a syrup you wouldn't be too far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I think I enjoyed this coffee more as an espresso than I did filter but both were enjoyable and had some interesting characteristics. Another good choice by KaffeBox and as always I'll look forward to the next month's offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the jazz this week I found myself reaching for a record released in 1989 - french pianist Michel Petrucciani's &quot;Music&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/069-Music/Music.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel is quite an inspiring character, being born with osteogenesis imperfecta (&quot;brittle bone disease&quot;) leading to him being short and often in a lot of pain - he still managed to become one of the greatest jazz pianists of his generation. Inspiring and influencing countless musicians during his relatively short career in the 80s and 90s.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dR7amlVCW6o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Michel's style was particularly interesting for the period. During the 80s and early 90s fusion ruled the roost with many players ditching the acoustic instruments and playing rock inspired pieces. In contrast Michel was a bit of a throw back, he had a much more lyrical and contemplative and was often compared to Bill Evans. He was a more multi-faceted player than being just a straight Evans clone however, he also combined this with blazing virtuosity (and given the pain he experienced while playing this is no mean feat) along with wider influences from the sounds of Paris, Brazil and elsewhere. That's not to say he couldn't hang with the fusion boys too (for example on the fantastic &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; - which may appear in a future blog post at some point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music marked the start of Michel's experimentation with synthesizers and richer and more expansive arrangements. Unlike other records from the era the use of synth is very tasteful and often features as an instrument that doubles a piano line or is deeper in the mix to just add depth. This avoids the album feeling and sounding &quot;dated&quot; by today's standards, which cannot be said for a lot of albums released in the late 80s (as much as I love some of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line-up on Music is fairly fluid, with musicians subbing in and out on the various tracks of the album. This does not stop it feeling like a single cohesive piece of work however, owing to the vision of Petrucciani. The line-up is not awash with &quot;big names&quot; (although this doesn't mean much, there are all-star line-up albums that are absolute rotters) but there are two familiar names that do appear: Lenny White on the drums - best known for his fusion work. And on the last track a tasty guest soprano sax solo from Joe Lovano (Petrucciani later appears on Lovano's seminal &quot;From the Soul&quot; album which we covered a few weeks back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to do an album like Music justice by just picking a few tunes to highlight. The album covers a lot of ground. At the start of this blog I embedded one of the most memorable pieces: &quot;My Bebop Tune&quot;. This is a crazy piece with a complicated stop-start melody with lots of twists and turns. It almost comes across as Michel mocking the ardent be-bop community for their obsession with needless complexity. I have always felt the tune is a little tongue in cheek, but others may disagree with me there. Either way it is a very cool piece that really shows off Petrucciani's chops as both a composer and player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the album is perhaps &quot;Lullaby&quot;. This is an absolutely beautiful piece full of the most delectable lines and a heartfelt presentation. Jazz artists often (wrongly) get accused of focussing only on the technical aspects of the music are incapable of portraying real emotion, if presented with that challenge one only needs to present &quot;Lullaby&quot; to make the argument null and void. I think you'll struggle to find a piece in any genre with more heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final track &quot;Thinking of Wayne&quot; (below) features the Lovano guest solo part way through. This track is likely one of the more &quot;modern jazz&quot; sounding pieces on the album. Given some of the licks and compositional style I imagine this is a tribute to Wayne Shorter since this could have easily been a Shorter penned track on a Weather Report album. However I do not have anything to back this up as I no longer own a physical version of this album to check the liner notes. Regardless another very cool piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only a very small selection of what Music has to offer. You also have the Brazillian inspired &quot;Brazilian Suite No. 2&quot; and the Parisian &quot;Memories Of Paris&quot; featuring another guest Gil Goldstein on accordian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of &quot;rating&quot; I wouldn't quite place Music in the &quot;essential listening&quot; tier. It is a fantastic album that I always enjoy listening to but it is probably not quite an all-time classic. If you are already a fan of jazz and looking to expand your listening it is a good place to go to study Petrucciani's style. I think the music itself is quite approachable so it is worth listening to if this post has piqued your interest.

&lt;/center&gt;

This week marks another edition of the Plot Icon series. The coffees in this series are some of the most sort after, exciting and hard to get hold of coffees in the world - and so I'm always looking forward to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the coffee is from Finca Guyubito located in Huila, Colombia - an area very well known to coffee nerds as many great coffees come from Huila. There are two aspects that make this coffee intriguing: firstly the cultivar is Java. This cultivar is well known for producing exceptional cup quality but also offers fairly good resistance to leaf rust and pests. World coffee research describes it as &quot;a good alternative to Gesha for small farmers&quot; due to these properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as with many of the Icon offerings we have an interesting processing method: namely a yeast fermentation. In this case yeast is added to the 36 hour fermentation step. Yeast addtions/fermentations are becoming increasingly popular in specialty coffee. They offer a reliable way to develop interesting coffee flavours. They are not without &quot;controversy&quot; however as some consider this &quot;cheating&quot; and you end up tasting the yeast rather than the coffee itself. I'm more open to the idea personally and am interested to see how the trend develops. For me a good basic washed coffee will still be where my heart is however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive straight into the coffee itself. As with the other Icon series this coffee was supplied in relatively small amounts so I'm not going to play around with espresso - the blog is filter only this week! The dry aroma on the nose gives quite a delicate fragrance. I would describe it as a slightly tropical fruit scent with just an edge of funk. But there is also a soft roundness to it too almost like a marshmallow quality. It does not give you a big hit around the face with aroma but it is certainly intriguing and inviting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week also marks the first time in around 18 months I've been able to locate my favoured Chemex filter papers (also via Plot). It has been very difficult to find these for a reasonable price during these times (I heard it was due to a paper shortage from so many disposable face masks being manufactured but that could just be a rumour). So brewing this coffee via the chemex paper the first thing I notice is the tropical fruit note. I would describe it more as melon, watermelon, mango, lychee and so on as opposed to the more acidic passionfruit style tropical notes. This gives way to a slight funk, but it is far from a funky-bus coffee - in fact the cup has a lot of the &quot;washed&quot; clarity which makes it very interesting. The mouthfeel is fairly creamy and heavy, more so than you'd expect from a sweet, fruit forward coffee such as this. The aftertaste is clean but fairly long lived and has a &quot;moreish&quot; sort of quality that makes you want to come back and take another sip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another top quality coffee from the Icon series (and I would expect nothing less). It is one that rewards those who put the effort in to identify all the flavours. And real appreciation comes from studying the complexities, if you're looking for an easy daily drinker you might not get the most from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our classic jazz this week we're getting a bit free heading back to 1961 with Eric Dolphy's second release &quot;Out There&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/068-Out-There/Out-There.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dolphy had a career tragically cut short at the age of 36 due to undiagnosed diabetes. He has left us with countless gems in his back catalogue however. He is perhaps best known for his collaborative work with Charles Mingus and he appeared on many classic releases such as &quot;Mingus at Antibes&quot;, &quot;Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus&quot;, &quot;Pre Bird&quot; and &quot;Charles Mingus presents Charles Mingus&quot;. He also appeared on some Coltrane records most notably &quot;Africa Brass&quot; and &quot;Live at the Village Vanguard&quot;. Regular readers may also remember the name from Oliver Nelson's &quot;Blues and Abstract Truth&quot; and Andrew Hill's &quot;Point of Departure&quot;. For a recorded career spanning little more than 5 years Eric appeared on many of the classic recordings of the era.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/82ze33xq_Eg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Here we look at Dolphy as a band leader however. During his lifetime he released 5 studio recordings and 2 live works, here we take a look at &quot;Out There&quot; his second recording and possibly my favourite in his back catalogue. His most famous release is undoubtedly &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; released posthumously on the Blue Note label, while I love this album (I'm sure it will feature on this blog eventually) I find myself reaching for &quot;Out There&quot; more often. As these names suggest we're looking at &quot;outside&quot; and free styles of jazz here, as a statement &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; certainly takes us further out of our comfort zone - but &quot;Out There&quot; manages to seemlessly combine the inside and outside elements. This is a quality I'm always drawn to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect that makes &quot;Out There&quot; so intriguing is the instrumentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric Dolphy — alto saxophone, bass clarinet, B-flat clarinet, flute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ron Carter — cello&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Duvivier — bass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roy Haynes — drums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of two &quot;bass&quot; instruments is a masterstroke. Since there are no &quot;chord instruments&quot; it completely frees up both space in the mix and means Eric is not tied down harmonically. He has completely free reign to play as outside as he likes and allows him to resolve ideas in ways that are much more difficult with a fuller band behind him. It is hard to imagine how audiences would have reacted to this back then, at this point they would have heard Ornette and some of the early free jazz movement but for me Dolphy is far more surprising and even today (60 years later!) his music is challenging and fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also worth taking a moment to give a shout out to Carter's cello playing. He is best known as a bassist and if you've read this blog for any amount of time you'll see he pops up just about everywhere. You don't often hear him on cello (nor do you hear much cello in jazz generally) but his playing on &quot;Out There&quot; (especially the down tempo pieces) is one of the reasons the album is so memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would break &quot;Out There&quot; down into two halves: you have the uptempo numbers (for example the title track embedded at the start of this post and &quot;17 West&quot; embeded at the end) which take a bit of a nod towards the be-bop and post-bop movements but interprets them through the lens of free jazz. The music pulls you from the comfortable feeling of be-bop through to phrases so outside they feel like they're from outer-space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half of the music on show is much more down-tempo in nature but no less experimental or free. One such example is the piece &quot;Eclipse&quot; (above) which was co-written by Charles Mingus. This is perhaps the most daring piece on the album taking an almost classical approach to composition. The strings form a rich sophisticated supporting landscape to Dolphy's melody, you can almost view it as a free-jazz update to the Duke Ellington compositional style. As the piece elegantly moves along Carter takes more and more liberties and plays some beautiful &quot;supporting solos&quot; to Dolphy's lines, it is a piece of detail you might not necessarily appreciate until a second or subsequent listen through the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all my Icon series posts I consider this album to be &quot;essential listening&quot; - both from a historical significance and music appreciation perspective. If you come from a be-bop or post-bop background and would like to take some first steps towards free-jazz there are much worse places to start. Or perhaps you have had a small taste of free-jazz and have yet to hear Dolphy in action. Even if you're a life-long Dolphy stan, it's still worth giving &quot;Out There&quot; another listen.

This week we're heading back to a favourite roaster of mine: Round Hill Roastery located in Bath, England. Round Hill have been around for a long time (in terms of specialty coffee in the UK) and I consider them one of the most reliable roasters around. The pricing is fair and the coffee top quality, they tend not to deal in &quot;unobtainium&quot; coffees. Instead they focus on more &quot;every day&quot; coffees that still taste fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee this week is a &quot;limited edition&quot; offering from Round Hill and is called &quot;Summer Claude&quot;. Long time readers may remember &quot;Spring Claude&quot; appearing on the blog previously, but for those that are newer readers: Monsieur Claude ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/monsieur_claude/&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/monsieur_claude/&lt;/a&gt; ) is a cat who every now and again selects the best coffees to be released under his name. I've had most of the Claude offerings (perhaps even all of them?) and they don't disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/067-Last-Chance-Disco/Summer-Claude.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee selected for the summer offering is a washed Ethiopian from the Nano Challa washing station. This is a very popular coffee and one that I have tried many (many) times in the past. This is the first time I have seen or bought it in 2021 however, and so one I have been looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive right into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I get the &quot;typical&quot; bouquet of a washed Ethiopian - full of florals and stone fruits a-plenty. There is also a bit of a honey or caramel vibe to it too, but the immediate hit is from heady floral notes. These are the sort of aromas that get me excited to try the coffee itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a filter made in the usual way the floral and stone-fruit combo is really evident. The cup is complex and you get the &quot;peach-iced tea laced with jasmine&quot; vibe that you get from washed Ethiopians. This one is fairly &quot;intense&quot; compared to others, sometimes these sorts of coffees can be really delicate whereas Summer Claude packs a bit of a punch. As one would expect the mouthfeel and body is fairly low, the sweetness and acidity are both fairly high. The aftertaste is clean but lingering (quite a nice combination). As with many complex cups this one is sensitive to cup temperature and it takes you on a journey as the cup cools, but not in a way that grabs your attention - it is perfect for those moments when you &quot;just want a cup&quot; while doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto the espresso side of things. As always I went for the filter roasted option (you can also get an espresso roast option) - as this is my preference for espresso. My comments might not translate to the espresso roast option. Dialing in this coffee was interesting, it is fairly forgiving but what was immediately apparent was Summer Claude likes longer pulls. In the end I settled for about a 10-15s preinfuse followed by a 36-38s pull for a 1:2 ratio. This is unheard of for me and I rarely get anywhere near to these times. Claude could take this sort of punishment however and was better for it. The mouthfeel and body was improved and there wasn't a hint of bitter/overextraction. The shot becomes essentially a very concentrated version of the filter, these was still flavour separation but also a lot of intensity. A really fun shot of espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall another killer offering from Claude and Round Hill, just a very good example of a washed Ethiopian. I'll look forward to the next Claude!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week I found myself dusting off an album from 2005 - the second recording of the Acoustic Ladyland group &quot;Last Chance Disco&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/067-Last-Chance-Disco/Last-Chance-Disco.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's step back to the mid 2000s for a moment. There were a few jazz trends going on around the world, you had the jazz-funk-avant sound of Medeski Martin and Wood (and those they influenced) still going strong and in Europe you had the Esbjorn Svensson Trio (and the millions of copy cat acts). In the UK however we had a bit of a trend in the form of &quot;Jazz-Punk&quot;. One of the best acts in that genre (in my opinion at least) were Acoustic Ladyland. The band consisted of British musicians:

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bbXISucyPME&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pete Wareham – saxophones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Cawley – keyboards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Herbert – bass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sebastian Rochford – drums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you would guess by the name: Acoustic Ladyland started off interpreting the music of Jimi Hendrix (on acoustic instruments). By &quot;Last Chance Disco&quot; (about 3-4 years after their debut) they went to electric instruments and began writing their own music. Founder Pete Wareham describes the inspiration for the album being his &quot;frustration with jazz and desire to infuse the ethic and fun of punk&quot;. My memory of the timelines are a little hazy but it is certainly one of the first albums I remember taking on the &quot;Jazz-Punk&quot; label which was later picked up by bands like &quot;(Get) The Blessing&quot; and &quot;Led Bib&quot; amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you would expect from the &quot;punk&quot; label, a large focus of the music is on energy and attitude. This is not an album to pick up if you're after refined and elegant harmony - instead it's perhaps closer to instrumental rock music in its conception. The majority of the tunes are built around relatively simple melodies that act as the hook. These are usually built around rather simple chord changes and progressions and the interest comes from the change in dynamics, timing and all out aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of &quot;Last Chance Disco&quot; (and other Acoustic Ladyland recordings) is the inclusion of drummer Seb Rochford. We have talked about Seb briefly in the Sons of Kemet blog post. His drumming style is unique and is generally quite easy to spot. While many jazz drummers are what I would call &quot;cymbal focussed&quot;, Seb tends to work the toms more and brings in influences and beats you might be more likely to hear in world music by the way of death metal. I also got to meet Seb at a gig before and he's a thoroughly nice chap to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually at this point I like to disect some of the tracks on the album a little bit to talk about what makes them great, that doesn't really feel in the punk spirit of Acoustic Ladyland so I have instead embedded a few choice tracks and let the attitude and vibe speak for itself. I have tried to make picks that highlight the breadth of what's on offer: from the heavy-metal carnage of &quot;Iggy&quot; (at the start of this post). Through to the funk and noise-rock oddity of &quot;Of You&quot; (above). And the anthemic closing track &quot;Nico&quot; (below) which became a bit of a signature track for the band.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GL2VUsHCqA4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

While &quot;Last Chance Disco&quot; might not quite be worthy of &quot;essential listening&quot; status, it sure is a fun listen and is certainly &quot;of a time&quot;. This was music best enjoyed live though (preferably at a small, sweaty &quot;rock&quot; type venue with a party atmosphere). I'm not sure if the &quot;jazz-punk&quot; thing made it out of the UK, it was a very short-lived trend amongst UK based bands. I'd be interested to hear from any European of Transatlantic readers whether jazz-punk found its way to your shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

For the past month or so this blog has focussed on either: unobtainium coffees, wild processing methods and roasters from all around the globe. This week we head back to some &quot;normality&quot; with a more &quot;everyday&quot; coffee. The roaster in question is our old friend Plot Roasting from Woolwich, London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee itself is from Ethiopia from a farm called Ana Sora located in Guji, Oromia. This is quite a popular producer and the coffees tend to be talked about fondly, many people calling it their favourite producer. The farm is owned by Israel Degfa who we have talked about on this blog in the past. As a re-cap, Israel owns many farms throughout Eithopia (mostly in the Oromia region) and supports local farmers and communities by offering financing, investing in healthcare, education and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many Ethiopian coffees the cultivar breakdown is not well understood and this coffee is simply listed as &quot;heirloom&quot; - a catch-all phrase for &quot;who knows?&quot;. This coffee has been naturally processed but there is not much info to be found on the exact processing undertaken. The altitude of this coffee is worthy of note being 1900-2350 masl - this is very high, which causes coffee to grow more slowly. The theory being that the slower growing leads to a more complex cup profile (although I am a little sceptical about this and haven't found altitude to be a good predictor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive right into the coffee itself. On the dry aroma I get the delicate floral notes one would expect from a Guji. Combined of course with the stone fruit qualities present in pretty much all Ethiopian coffee. On the nose it is not a &quot;flavour bomb&quot; but it is certainly inviting. Brewed as a filter in the usual way: the notes from the nose carry over. You get the typical apricot and peach iced tea notes as expected, but these give way to floral violet and lavendar notes in the finish. It is not the most perfumed example I've ever tasted but it is still a complex cup. Overall the balance is in favour of sweetness compared to acidity, most likely due to the natural processing of this coffee. In terms of body and mouthfeel I'd describe it as a medium and the aftertaste is fairly long lived but reasonably clean. While being a natural it isn't a &quot;strong natural&quot; and manages to retain quite a lot of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In espresso I find this coffee really shines. All the flavour notes mentioned previously just get intesified - so you essentially end up with a concentrated apricot syrup flavoured with violets! I found this coffee can tolerate shorter ratios and I ended up dialing in to around 1:2.1-ish in around 27s - so a fairly typical profile. The roast level is quite light so the coffee works nicely in longer/much longer ratios too but in a more concentrated form I find the mouthfeel more appealling. It is a very forgiving coffee in as much as you can play with ratio/time at will, however I found that small grinder adjustments made a big difference so it might not be great for those with stepped grinders. Temperature wise I kept the machine at full whack owing to roast (this is intended as a filter roast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a solid &quot;everyday&quot; coffee and a good example of what to expect from a Guji natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week we are taking a look at one of my guitar heros: Ted Greene with his 1977 release &quot;Solo Guitar&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/066-Solo-Guitar/Solo-Guitar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Greene may be a new name to anybody who is not a guitarist (and even to many guitarists too). He was never a &quot;big&quot; name, and in fact &quot;Solo Guitar&quot; represents his only studio recording. Outside of this album there are only a few low resolution videos and recordings dotted around the internet of him. One may ask: how can somebody like this become a guitar-hero for many jazz guitarists? The first answer to this is: listen to Solo Guitar! But another answer is: Ted's biggest passion was jazz education. He has given us guitarists a treasure trove of lessons, transcriptions and ideas to work with. He reportedly said he didn't enjoy playing live music or recording as it made him nervous, but he was perfectly happy teaching a room full of people all about jazz guitar.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjDGYFZuJSU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

So what makes Ted's playing so special? You may be asking, it is his knowledge of chords and harmony. Dire Straits may have said: &quot;Check guitar George, he knows all the chords&quot; - really they should have been talking about Ted Greene. He came up with so many beautiful chord voicings and in his arrangements he often interchanged the voicings at will - some close interval, some wide interval, some voicings you never hear elsewhere. His approach to doing this was totally unique and you can tell when people are &quot;doing Ted&quot; in their playing, but very few manage to pull it off convincingly (Tim Lerch is one in the Ted Greene style who has managed to incorporate Ted's ideas in a natural way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted had many other far influencing ideas beyond harmony: he is (to my knowledge) one of the first jazz guitarists to use a telecaster - something later popularised by Frisell, Stern and others. He also made use of the harp-harmonic techniques, again something not that popular when he was doing it. Perhaps the biggest of his influences was his use of &quot;neck vibrato&quot; in jazz guitar. This is where you hold the body of the guitar against you and push/pull the neck to gently apply vibrato to the notes. This has become a staple for other jazz guitarists, perhaps most notably Bill Frisell who uses this technique frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Solo Guitar&quot; as an album, as the name suggests, focusses on solo guitar arrangements. Each tune is a standard or &quot;pop&quot; tune and so the music should be somewhat familiar anybody listening. Of course the magic is in the arrangment, these are not typical jazz guitar arrangements. There is a certain elegance and beauty to what is being played. Many guitarists (jazz or otherwise) fall into the trap of making music that appeals only to guitarists but with Ted I feel there's a lot to appeal to a much wider audience. It is a shame that he didn't leave us with a much wider range of recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking a few select tracks from the album is difficult as there's something to be taken from each arrangement. One of the tracks I particularly enjoy is &quot;Danny Boy&quot; (embedded at the start of this post), the intro to the track shows off Ted's creative use of harp-harmonics to extend out chord voicings and shows off that enviable knowledge of harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another favourite track would be &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; (above). Through the use of creative voicings he manages to take a tune that can often end up sounding a bit &quot;dull&quot; and breathes new life into it. Continuing the theme of potentially &quot;dull&quot; tunes is &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; (below) - what is particularly interesting about this one is the use of his time, he goes between periods of straight and swing and gently undulates between the two at will, often while changing tempo or feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would hesitate to call &quot;Solo Guitar&quot; an &quot;essential&quot; album for a jazz record collection, the arrangements are terrific and inspiring but it is more of a &quot;musician's album&quot; than one for a general jazz fan. You also have to put up with less than ideal recording quality. But it is well worth giving it a listen and I think it is certainly one of the more interesting solo jazz-guitar records out there.

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we have another instalment of my KaffeBox subscription - this time featuring coffee from: Fuglen Coffee Roasters, located in Oslo, Norway. This is the first time I've even heard of these guys and girls, part of the joy of a subscription such as this, and so one I was looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I want to note is the aesthetic of the coffee bags: they are very much my style. Each bag features a rather funky artwork, an example is below (taken from their webstore: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fuglencoffee.no/&quot;&gt;https://www.fuglencoffee.no/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/065-Weather-Report/Fuglen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each artwork features a depiction of a bird - and after some google translating I now know that &quot;fuglen&quot; is &quot;the bird&quot; in Norwegian. Apart from the artwork the bags are pretty sparse with just the basic information you need: origin, produers, region, varietals, processing and roast date. I appreciate this approach, simple and to the point. Also plus points for using coffee bags that are easily recyclable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may recall as part of my subscription I receive 2 small bags (125g) of coffee - to allow me to dial in effectively I dedicate one to filter and one to espresso. This week I received a Kenyan and a Colombian coffee and I typically do not favour Kenyan coffee as espresso so that one was dedicated to filter duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start on the filter side: the Kenyan coffee is from the Kiambu County and produced by the Ndumberi Farmer coop. The stated cultivars are: SL-34, Ruiru-11, Batian and SL-28 (Peaberry). For those unaware: a peaberry is a mutation where each coffee cherry contains only 1 seed (&quot;bean&quot;) rather than 2 seperated by mucilage. Peaberries are very easy to identify visually as the beans will be &quot;rounded&quot; instead of having 1 flat side. It was/is believed that peaberry coffees taste better and so command a higher price, this is not something I've particularly noticed in the past so I tend not to search out peaberries specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto the coffee itself: the coffee is roasted a touch darker (visually) than one might expect from a &quot;nordic&quot; (but it is by no means &quot;dark&quot;). On the dry aroma you get the normal washed Kenyan profile: a very strong hit of blackcurrants. On aroma alone it is hard to get much more from it. Once it has been brewed again the predominant note is blackcurrant - as you would expect. Alongside are a supporting cast of rhubarb, orange, pink grapefruit and melon. Overall a very solid example of a washed Kenyan coffee. The acidity level is noticable but not overbearing, the sweetness is medium-low - just enough to take the edge off the acidity. If you like Kenyan coffees you'll like this one a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the espresso side we have a Colombian coffee from Tarqui, Huila. The farm in question is called Finca El Prado and the producer is Ferney Cruz Trujillo. The coffee has been washed and the cultivar is Caturra. In terms of dialing in the settings from the previous espresso I was running were nearly perfect so there was little for me to tweak and so I can't comment on how hard this one is to dial in. I found a ratio of 1:2.25 to work well in around 25s all in. This gave just enough mouthfeel but allowed the flavour notes to be adequately separated. The main notes for me were stone fruits along with a grapefruit acidity. It was not the most complex shot of espresso I ever had but it was very drinkable and highly enjoyable. I would describe it as a medium for acidity, sweetness and body - it's just the sort of coffee you can really enjoy. If I had to pick between the two coffees I'd say this one is my favourite of the pair, it just hit the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the jazz side this week I dug out a bit of an overlooked record from a band that is not at all overlooked: the 1982 self-titled &quot;Weather Report&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/065-Weather-Report/Weather-Report.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a move that confused record collectors and record shops alike, in 1982 Weather Report released their 10th studio album &quot;Weather Report&quot; - which shared a title with their 1971 debut album. I think this confusion led to this album being slightly overlooked in the Weather Report back catalogue, which is unfortunate as it is a great album. This is the second Weather Report album I ever owned - I remember purchasing the classic &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; on CD and loving it. Shortly after I found a vinyl copy of &quot;Weather Report&quot; (1982) in a second hand record store for very little money so I snapped it up without really knowing much about it.

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gDCHFgeoiY4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

It is probably worth going into a little band history to put this album into context: the fusion super-group was formed/co-led by keyboard/pianist Joe Zawinul and saxophonist Wayne Shorter, who had previously worked together on Miles Davis' &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;. The band has had many other musicians pass through the ranks but by far the most successful/popular line-ups feature the great Jaco Pastorius on the bass and Peter Erskine on the drums. &quot;Weather Report&quot; (1982) is the last album to feature this classic line-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music itself has a kind of &quot;end of an era&quot; feel to it also - the collaborative efforts on previous albums make way for some of Joe Zawinul's more ambitious arrangements. The album feels a bit like a cross-over between Weather Report and The Zawinul Syndicate (Joe's next project). Jaco in particular seems to take a back seat on &quot;Weather Report&quot; - his only writing credit is in the concluding extended jam and he doesn't really take the limelight with any memorable basslines on this one. Many of his basslines are doubled by Zawinul's synths - something which angered Jaco and led him to a more &quot;acoustic&quot; direction in his following solo career. The album is therefore one for the Zawinul fans (of which I am certainly one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album kicks off in style with the grooving &quot;Volcano For Hire&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog post). This could have featured on just about any of the &quot;classic&quot; Weather Report recordings and not felt out of place. It highlights Erskine's unique drum grooves (supported by percussionist Robert Thomas Jr.), Zawinul's compositional voice and moments of magic from Jaco and Wayne. The tune has a nod to the &quot;world music&quot; style that Weather Report and Zawinul in particular were known for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most ambitious tune on the album is likely the 3 movement &quot;NYC&quot; suite (above). The piece is probably the most &quot;swinging&quot; on the album with Zawinul experimenting with the tonal and harmonic possibilities of his synths. There are many twists and turns throughout the piece and it keeps you on your toes and continually surprises. It is probably the most &quot;Syndicate&quot;-ish tune on the album and an interesting piece of history to see where Zawinul was heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album concludes with the jam &quot;Dara Factor Two&quot; (below) - this is the only piece on the album that has writing credits from all band members (elsewhere on the album Shorter has one writing credit for &quot;When It Was Now&quot; with Zawinul picking up all other credits). The collaborative nature of this piece gives it a very different feeling to the rest of the album and it shows what great improvisers were in this band - it acts as a fitting send off for this incarnation of Weather Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to it's lack of commercial success I wouldn't place this in the &quot;essential listening&quot; category (like say &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; or &quot;Black Market&quot;) but for Weather Report fans (or fans of fusion in general) it is worth checking out if it is a record you have overlooked.

&lt;/center&gt;

This week we have another coffee in the Icon series from the folks at Plot Coffee Roasting. This time we have an origin I rarely go for: Brazil. The stereotypes for Brazilian coffees are &quot;chocolatey&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot;, &quot;nutty&quot; and so on. These are not flavour notes I tend to favour. As you'd expect from an &quot;unobtainium&quot; coffee in the Icon series, this is not a typical coffee from Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coffee is from Daterra Coffee, located in Cerrado - the first &quot;A&quot; grade rainforest certified farm. Within Daterra coffee there is the &quot;Masterpiece Farm&quot; from which this particular lot was grown. Masterpiece is a dedicated research facility looking into the latest and greatest cultivars, processing methods and so on. Each lot is very small and they often achieve cup scores in excess of 90 (i.e. very good!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular coffee is a Aramosa cultivar - this is a &quot;pre-cultivar&quot; as its genetics are still being studied. Needless to say you don't see these very often and it is a first for me. The Aramosa is a cross between Arabica coffee and Racemosa coffee species. Nearly all the coffees on this blog are Arabica, Racemosa is harder to find - it brings with it naturally low caffeine and is drought and disease resistant. This is important for the future of coffee and so it is very interesting to see what happens with these latest &quot;cross&quot; cultivars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the cultivar this coffee is also an anaerobic processed lot. We have spoken about anaerobic processing in the past - the removal of oxygen in the fermentation process allows for different flavour compounds to develop. This coffee is therefore a full-house in the game of &quot;high end coffee bingo&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this fanciness means a thing unless the coffee tastes good however, so lets move onto the important stuff. As always with these Icon coffees the amounts are too low to reliably dial in espresso and taste as filter so this blog post is a filter coffee only post (normal espresso service to resume next week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the dry aroma I get a very interesting profile, it is immediately recognisable as something different. I would describe it as sweet like, but old-fashioned sweets like parma violets, love hearts, etc. Quite a &quot;soft&quot; profile and almost a powder-y floralness to them. But there is also a bit of tropical funk there too but it is very restrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cup the first thing to notice is a complete lack of bitterness. The coffees we feature on this blog are typically not bitter to begin with, but this is a noticable step down. I can only presume it is the reduced caffeine levels. I would describe this as a soft and delicate coffee, it is one that only gives up its flavours when you really look for them. The cup itself is very complex, there are a lot of florals packed in there. Alongside is the powder-y sherbet-type sweetness we got off the nose. I also notice a feint aniseed note when the cup reaches just the right temperature too. In terms of fruity notes it has some tropical notes there along with your stone fruits. The sweetness level is high and the mouthfeel gives the impression of stickyness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting cup, it is hard to describe because it is different to most other coffees I drink. It is one you really have to try for yourself to appreciate it. Yet again Plot manage to surprise with their Icon series, as always I look forward to see what the next month brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is customary on Icon coffee posts I pick a jazz icon to pair with it. Amazingly it has taken 64 blog posts for this musician to appear: welcome to the blog John Coltrane. We take a look at his 1961 studio release &quot;Africa/Brass&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/064-Africa-Brass/Africa-Brass.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of &quot;classic&quot; Coltrane recordings &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; might seem an &quot;odd&quot; first choice for the blog. While it is perhaps less well known than some of the other more successful recordings &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; is one of my favourite Coltrane recordings. I'm going to say something controversial here: but I don't particularly enjoy many of Coltranes albums under his own name. The ones that are good are fantastic, but I feel there is a lot of filler too and I'm not a fan of &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; or any of the &quot;spiritual&quot; albums that followed. I can only assume my membership to the jazz-bloggers union is going to be quickly revoked after posting such heresy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Africa/Brass&quot; was released on Impulse records - now a legendary record label, but &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; marks only the 6th release on Impulse. This was quite a bold move by the label all things considered. While Coltrane was a big name after hits such as the impressive &quot;Giant Steps&quot; and &quot;Blue Train&quot; which earned him the reputation of being an all time great - &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; strayed quite far from the Coltrane formula through the addition of a big-band orchestra. As if the 21 piece big-band wasn't strange enough even the instrumentation is quite weird through the use of french horns and euphoniums. This is quite a big risk for a fledgling label when they could have just churned out a &quot;cutting date&quot; with the Coltrane band and sold a lot of units. I'm glad they took the risk however, as &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; is really a special album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album consists of just 3 tracks (modern reissues feature many more) and spans just 33 minutes in length (perhaps the one downside of the album). There are two Coltrane originals &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Blues Minor&quot; along with a reworking of &quot;Greensleeves&quot;. The orchestration comes courtesy of pianist and long-time collaborator McCoy Tyner and (perhaps a bit left-field) Eric Dolphy. The Dolphy connection perhaps adds to some of the &quot;weirdness&quot; in the orchestration, but it certainly adds to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such long track lengths there is of course ample opportunity for extended soloing as you'd expect from a Coltrane record. John is on top form throughout his earlier &quot;sheets of sound&quot; firebreathing is still there but this is paired with the modal playing that dominated his later recordings. For me he catches just the right balance between the two. The contrast with the big band is also fascinating. I am also a huge fan of Coltrane on Soprano, I think he is if anything underated on this instrument as all the focus tends to be on his tenor magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is a big band record, the core of the album is still the Coltrane Quartet. At this time consisting of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Coltrane – soprano and tenor saxophone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McCoy Tyner – piano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reggie Workman – bass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elvin Jones – drums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the album McCoy does McCoy things and he is instantly recognisable. He is such a huge part of the Coltrane sound of this era. He provides the &quot;dream like&quot; feel that allows John to really express himself. And of course he is no slouch himself, providing some killer piano solos throughout. Then of course we have the core of any band, the drummer. In this case Elvin Jones keeps things grooving and drives the music forward. For me one of the greatest drummers of all time. His voice is totally unique and again adds to the Coltrane sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so few tracks it is hard to talk about &quot;top tracks&quot; so I have just embedded side 2 of the album in this post. To really appreciate this album, however, you should really listen from start to finish. I would recommend sticking to the &quot;original&quot; track listing rather than the extended re-issues as I don't think they add anything to the experience and really are just for the completist. If you have not heard &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; before you should definitely hunt down a copy, and if you have heard it before maybe it's time to give it another spin? As with many albums on this blog it is in the &quot;must listen&quot; category and well worth investing the time in.

&lt;/center&gt;

For a bit of a change of pace on the blog this week we have a brand new roaster (to this blog): Sey Coffee ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seycoffee.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.seycoffee.com/&lt;/a&gt; ) from Brooklyn, NY. This is a roaster I have never sampled from before, importing coffee from the US is always problematic for those of us this side of the Atlantic. The shipping is often highly unpredictable and expensive, that fancy lot you were desperate to try could turn up months late (or not at all). Fortunately, Prufrock Coffee in London ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://prufrockcoffee.com/&quot;&gt;https://prufrockcoffee.com/&lt;/a&gt; ) have started a webstore and so we have access to some interesting roasters from all over the world with very little inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sey have been on my &quot;to try&quot; list for quite a while and so I was happy to see their coffees become available. I already had to many bags of coffee so unfortunately I could only warrant a single bag to try. This of course raised the difficult question: which to try? Of the four or so on offer I opted for the Colombian &quot;La Luna&quot;, the selection criteria was fairly simple: it all came down to cultivar. This coffee is a 100% Pacamara lot. Pacamara is a cultivar that has very low yields and is extremely susceptible to pests/disease but has exceptional cup quality. It is one of my favourite cultivars but you do not see it very often. The coffee itself has undergone a pulped natural processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving straight in to the coffee itself. On the dry aroma: I'm getting honey and floral notes mostly but there is a feint fruity note in the background. It is not a particualrly &quot;loud&quot; coffee on the nose but it is certainly very appealling. Upon opening the bag for the first time I actually said: &quot;oh wow&quot; out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a filter coffee things start to get interesting. The coffee has a sugar-y sort of sweetness to it, an almost candyfloss type of vibe. However there is a floral lavendar type of note (although I may be specifying lavendar because the packaging is purple). As the cup cools the florals become more present and they are particularly noticable in the finish. The fruit notes on the nose are also present, I would describe them as a raspberry sharpness. The bag mentions tropical notes, and while I can notice them I'm not sure I would have gone for that as a descriptor without being prompted. The cup itself is very clean and the sharp acidity helps with this. The body and mouthfeel are pretty low, for me this is not problem but for those enjoying the chewier bigger coffees this might be a little thin for your tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto the espresso now: this one was remarkably easy to work with, it just requires a fine grind. If you want to make something approaching a ristretto out of this coffee you'll need a truly top end grinder - I could just about get a 1:2 out of it with my grinder on the edge of chirp. Given the relatively low body of this coffee however there isn't any harm in going a bit longer and my preference was a 1:2.75 ratio - this allowed some of the floral notes in the aftertaste to still be present. Going shorter and the cup became a bit more 1 dimensional (although still delicious). The flavour profile in the espresso is similar to the filter but more concentrated: the candyfloss sweetness is perhaps more like a caramel or honey and the raspberry note is a bit more prominent at the expense of the lavendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall a kick-ass coffee from Sey, I'm glad I got to finally try some of their coffee and I'll be on the lookout for them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the jazz this week I found myself digging out an old Scofield record from 1990: &quot;Time on my Hands&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jazzcoffeestuff/blog/raw/master/images/063-Time-on-my-Hands/Time-on-my-Hands.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Time on my Hands&quot; is a one of the first vinyl records I ever bought. I remember purchasing it quite clearly, at the time I was fairly new to jazz and still exploring. I already owned two of Sco's albums (&quot;A Go Go&quot; and &quot;Uberjam&quot;) which I had on CD which I really enjoyed but I hadn't heard anything else from him. &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; was a really pleasant surprise, it was totally different to the other Sco albums I had heard at that point and probably more &quot;traditional&quot;, it kicked off a bit of a Sco obsession for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Time on my Hands&quot; is interesting for a number of reasons: firstly it is John's first record on Blue Note which has some cachet in of itself. But it is also a &quot;super-group&quot; type recording with an all-star cast of musicians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Scofield - guitar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Lovano - saxophone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlie Haden - bass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack DeJohnette - drums

&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8rpOUXpKYY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

With a lineup like this there is very little to go wrong! &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; is also the first recording with Sco and Lovano appearing together (to my knowledge) - and so the start of a successful partnership that produced many great records during the 90s. I believe this is what lifts &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; above other Sco records of the same era, while Sco's playing is always top-notch, the addition of Lovano seems to push Sco compositionally. The tunes on the album are much more recognisable and interesting than any on the previous Gramavision records. The interplay between John and Joe is also a joy to listen to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening back to the album in 2021, things do sound a little dated however. The production itself has a very &quot;80s&quot; feel to it. In addition this was when all jazz guitarists for some inexplicable reason decided that they should leave their chorus pedals on 24/7 (to be fair it was not just jazz guitarists, but they are some of the worst offenders). The result is a very dated sound which may be difficult for some to deal with. The sound does fit the music however, the chorus adds an almost faux-leslie vibe to the guitar sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have listened to this album so many times over the years it is hard to pick out just a few tracks to talk about. One of the main strengths of the album is there is absolutely no filler, each tune is worthy of being there. This is in contrast to some of the prior Scofield records which have the odd fantastic tune but then some that don't quite live up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite tunes off the album is &quot;Flower Power&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). For me it really sums up John's compositional voice at the time, the theme is relatively simple but the way he plays with the timing is what really brings the piece alive. His lead playing shows off his &quot;laid-back&quot; approach that he further developed in later recordings. This is one of the few tracks where Joe Lovano does not appear however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A track where John and Joe certainly work together, however, is &quot;Wabash III&quot; (embedded above). This is a reimagining of &quot;Wabash&quot; that appeared a couple of years earlier on his &quot;Loud Jazz&quot; album (if anybody knows what happened to &quot;Wabash II&quot; I'd be very interested to hear!) Whereas the previous version had a rock snarl, &quot;Wabash III&quot; is much more sophisticated and very indicative of the 90s jazz movement towards more &quot;traditional&quot; sounds. The John/Joe interplay on this track is certainly one of the highlights of the album and you can see why they continued to collaborate. I also love Joe's solo on this track and I have stolen a number of licks from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last pick is the closing track &quot;Fat Lip&quot; (embedded below). It's a tune with groove, swagger and rock attitude but also some sophistication. The sophistication of the compositions is a common theme throughout the album in general, the ideas are quite clever but they are done in a natural way and they are not thrown in your face in a &quot;look how clever I am&quot; way - I think this is why you can keep coming back to this album many years later. For the Scofield nerds out there: you can also hear the theme from &quot;I Don't Need No Doctor&quot; off his Ray Charles tribute album (and a riff John Mayer pinched for his own cover also).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of John Scofield, or jazz guitar in general, and you haven't picked up a copy of &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; you really should. The tone and production may be a bit dated now, but it is worth sticking with it - you will be handsomely rewarded for it.
