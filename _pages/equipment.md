My current coffee set ups are: <br/>
**Filter:** <br/>
* Orphan Espresso Apex Hand Grinder <br/>
* Hasami Brewer with Chemex papers / Aeropress <br/>
* KitchenAid artisan temperature controlled gooseneck kettle

**Espresso:** <br/>
* Compak e8 red speed grinder (Orphan Espresso Pharos for decaf) <br/>
* The Force flat base tamper <br/>
* Londinium R / Cafelat Robot

Water is treated with an Osmio Zero countertop RO unit. 

If you would like to hear my thoughts on any of the above please feel free to reach out. These were all bought with my own money and I have no affiliations to these companies.
