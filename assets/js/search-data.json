            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

          "content": "Hello, and welcome to my new blog: jazzcoffeestuff. . As the name suggests this blog is about two of my favourite topics: jazz and coffee (and other “stuff”!) . The specialty coffee business is a difficult one to navigate, I do not feel right in slating any roaster/producer. Coffee choice is personal and just because I do not bond with a coffee doesn’t mean it is “bad”. As such this blog will only feature positive coffee reviews, I do not write about every coffee I drink - only the particularly good ones! . I have no affiliations or monetary interests in any coffee business nor am I paid to review or feature coffees – this is merely a passion project. . My current coffee set ups are: Filter: . Orphan Espresso Apex Hand Grinder | Hasami Brewer with Chemex papers / Aeropress | . Espresso: . Compak e8 red speed grinder (Orphan Espresso Pharos for decaf) | The Force flat base tamper | Londinium R | . Water is treated with an Osmio Zero countertop RO unit. . I have been an avid jazz fan for a long time and listen to pretty much every type of jazz from the earliest swing through to the latest releases. I want to make jazz more accessible so I will shy away from highly technical analyses (although those are interesting too) – hopefully making it fun and providing an easy introduction to the genre. . In blog posts I try and include album artwork where appropriate – this is done using a fair use law for the purposes of identification. .
