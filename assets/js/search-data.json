            "title": "The Real McCoy and PLOT Gelana Gesha",
            "content": "Welcome to the 20th JazzCoffeeStuff post! . This week we are back to PLOT coffee roasting again. If you have read the previous blog posts you&#39;ll notice that (at the moment) there is little variation in roasters appearing on this page: this is intentional given the global situation. I recommend everybody support the businesses they like as it is a tough time for coffee roasters. As such I&#39;m doing less &quot;exploring&quot; and am spending more of my coffee money on the usual suspects. . Onto more positive notes: this week the coffee we&#39;re looking at is kind of interesting. It is a coffee from Ethiopia and from the Israel Degfa empire. I (partly) joke about calling it an empire, Israel owns a company Kerchanshe Trading who own a number of washing stations and mills throughout Ethiopia. If you are looking at high quality coffee from this region it won&#39;t take you long to come across the Israel Degfa name. Over the past few years he has been working tirelessly to improve the quality of coffee being produced. . In this instance the coffee we&#39;re looking at today is a natural process from the Gelana woreda in the (west) Guji zone of the Oromia Region. Guji is highly synonymous with high quality coffee and has featured on this blog in the past. Gelana is a small area that benefits from decent rainfall and fertile soil which is a good starting point for growing high quality coffee plants. Israel decided that this particular farm was a prime location to experiment and decided to plant a large number of Gesha plants. . We have talked about varietals in the past, but I believe this is the first Gesha we have featured on the blog. Gesha first came onto the scene around 2004 through the prized Panama farm Hacienda La Esmeralda. On the cupping table it produced such vibrant floral notes that many thought somebody had &quot;smuggled&quot; some Ethiopian coffee onto the table and it couldn&#39;t possibly be produced in Panama. This sparked an obssession with the varietal and quickly Gesha lots became the hottest lots in auctions reaching crazy price levels. Through the end of the 2000s and 2010s barista competitions essentially became &quot;Gesha shows&quot; - if you wanted to place you needed to have a special Gesha coffee to show off! But what is so special about Gesha itself? It originally hails from Ethiopia, first identified in the 1930s, samples got sent to Costa Rica in the 1950s and Panama planted samples as early as 1960s. The Gesha varietal is synonymous with &quot;floral&quot; notes particularly jasmine and bergamot and is almost always fruit focussed. They tend to be very perfumed with a big bouquet, as a result they regularly score in the 90s for SCA cup scores (remember 80 is the cutoff for specialty, getting into the 90s is incredibly rare &lt;1% of coffee produced each year globally gets into this bracket - essentially the best of the best). . What is particularly interesting about this coffee from PLOT is the price; for a Gesha it is simply outstanding value - it is the same price as their &quot;regular&quot; coffees. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever found a Gesha at this price point before so I was very eager to try it. Although I admit I was a little skeptical, like if you find a Ferarri in the autotrader for Â£1000. But given the last few coffees from PLOT I considered this a &quot;risk&quot; worth taking. . As a dry aroma from the ground beans the fragrance is a little subdued, this is something I regularly notice about Gesha coffees - they tend to be quite &quot;polite&quot; and never punch you in the face. There is certainly a peach note and also, as expected, the jasmine floral note. Another thing I instantly notice: this coffee is a very light roast, this is certainly one you could consider the mythical &quot;nordic roast&quot; style. Onto the filter, as usual a chemex filter type, the resulting coffee is clean as they come, there isn&#39;t a hint of &quot;funk&quot; from the natural processing. I would describe the flavour profile as relatively subtle but certainly complex. The main overiding flavour note for me is peach, it is like biting into a ripe juicy peach. As the cup cools the florals come out to play and it takes on an elderflower cordial sort of vibe - the sweetness of this coffee taking on that sticky almost jammy quality. What I found most astounding however was the aftertaste: out of nowhere a ripe banana note comes out. It is only evident in the aftertaste and there is no hint of it before, it is really suprising but unmistakable for me. This is a note that PLOT did not list on the bag but for me it&#39;s one of the major characters of the coffee. . Moving onto the espresso, a coffee roast this light can be a nightmare to dial in and you&#39;re left with a &quot;sweetspot&quot; living on a knife-edge with even the slightest change in puck-prep throwing the whole shot off. Fortunately this one was surprisingly easy to dial in on my setup, I didn&#39;t have any issues at all. In the end I settled for a 1:2.75 ratio out in 24s with my machine on maximum temperature. As with the filter the major flavour note for me was peach, the shot was super sweet with just enough acidity not to be cloying. Again it was a super clean flavour profile and there was little in the way of body or mouthfeel. Again the ripe banana note came out during the aftertaste but was slightly less pronounced in the espresso, the aftertaste of the filter lingered whereas the aftertaste of the espresso was fairly shortlived. . Overall this was a very interesting and delicious coffee. On the face of it a very simple delicate flavour profile but there was enough complexity there to keep you entertained too. It is certainly worth trying if it is still available as you read this. . For the jazz this week we are heading back to 1960s Blue Note with a hard-bop classic from McCoy Tyner: &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; . . McCoy Tyner is probably best known for being the pianist in the John Coltrane band - where he featured on many seminal albums such as &quot;My Favourite Things&quot;, &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; and &quot;Love Supreme&quot;, all of which are worthy of a blog post to themselves. He also had many other dates as a sideman for the likes of Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan, Hank Mobley, Freddie Hubbard and Joe Henderson along with many others. Today however we are focussed on his solo career which was equally prolific. &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; was released in 1967, some 2 years after he left the John Coltrane band. It was during this time he began to find his own voice as a leader. . It is safe to say McCoy is certainly in the &quot;modal&quot; school of post-bop jazz - for those who do not know music theory: a mode is essentially a degree of a scale, for example taking the major scale (&quot;do, ri, me, ...&quot;) there are seven associated &quot;modes&quot; of this scale depending on which note is the root (&quot;home&quot; note). Each mode has its own flavour/mood, in a modal composition we take a specific mode and build the entire tune around that, this gives pieces a specific &quot;mood&quot; or &quot;feeling&quot;. This is in contrast to, say, be-bop where the focus is on chord changes and the melody follows the structure of the chord and so a composition may feature many different scales in passing. Modal jazz became very popular with post-bop artists and even many modern records still use a modal concept. . Another factor of McCoy&#39;s playing is his powerful left hand playing, he often relies on big choppy chords to drive the pieces forward. This often brings an authoritative punch to the compositions and drives the music forward. There is a certain &quot;stride&quot; influence to this but it is certainly his own sound and it is unmistakable, you can often hear other players doing a &quot;McCoy impression&quot; but never quite getting it right. Of course another big part of his playing is his reliance on fourth intervals that appear throughout his work, many of his chord voicings are based around the idea of stacking fourths - he even has an album named &quot;Reaching Fourth&quot; so they clearly meant a lot to him. . Let&#39;s look at the rest of the line up on this album now: . McCoy Tyner - piano | Joe Henderson - tenor saxophone | Ron Carter - bass | Elvin Jones - drums | . As with the majority of albums featured on this blog: this line up is stellar. . If you have read any of the previous blog posts you&#39;ll know about Joe Henderson at this point, one of my favourite artists of all time. As you&#39;d expect Joe&#39;s improvisation is top notch playing some really intricate and interesting lines, he doesn&#39;t get quite as &quot;free&quot; as he does on his own albums (understandably) but he matches perfectly the energy of Tyner throughout. Joe is one of those players who is equally talented as a sideman (by not taking the spotlight away from the named artist) and leading a band himself. . Then on the bass there is Ron Carter, again a legend who has appeared on this blog on numerous posts (although not yet as a solo artist). The magic in Carter&#39;s playing for me is his ability to accompany other players, it is an often underappreciated skill. The best accompanists have a quality that I like to describe as &quot;holding up a mirror&quot; where they manage to allow the soloing musician to sound &quot;even more like themselves&quot; - Ron has this ability in abundance. This is certainly on display in this album where you have McCoy&#39;s compositions being fairly harmonically dense and frantic solos from McCoy and Joe - if Ron came to the session with ego and not willing to allow the others to speak it could quickly turn into a car crash. The other aspect of Carter&#39;s playing that is so impressive to me is his command of rhythm, he can really find the pocket when things get complicated. He is certianly deserving of his reputation as one of the finest bass players in jazz. . Lastly we have drummer Elvin Jones. Without doubt one of my absolute favourite drummers of all time. Like McCoy, Elvin spent much of his early career playing as a sideman with some of the great artists: in the 1950s with Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins (appearing on the &quot;A Night at the Village Vanguard&quot; - an all time classic) and the 1960s appearing in the John Coltrane band alongside McCoy. Again the list of artists and albums he has worked with and on is basically a &quot;who&#39;s who&quot; of jazz. His playing style is very fluid, playing legato like phrases on the drums. This gives him a rubbery slippery sound that influenced jazz (and other genres) for decades afterwards and still to this day. He manages to maintain this quality while playing sophisticated polyrhymic ideas, which is not easy to do. With complex ideas like this it is very easy for the drumming to begin to sound &quot;robotic&quot; but Elvin keeps things swinging. However Elvin also had the ability to play thunderous and powerful lines when required, he was far from a &quot;one trick pony&quot;. Without a doubt one of the best drummers of all time, not just in the jazz world. . The album starts with &quot;Passion Dance&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog) which is the opening track and one of the album&#39;s highlights. It is a fairly dense piece with a complicated melody, however it is essentially a blueprint on band interaction and connection. Each player is solely concerned with lifting the music and not themselves. This is perhaps most evident with the rhythmic interplay between McCoy and Elvin. Joe takes a blistering solo too, tap-dancing through the chaos to play something beautiful. This focus on connection is evident throughout the album, while some of the other compositions may be less manic there is always a sense of cohesion and togetherness. . Another tune that sticks out for me on this album is the closing track: &quot;Blues on The Corner&quot; As the name suggests this is a take on the blues, however as you&#39;d expect it is a little more sophisticated than that. While Elvin showed off his power in &quot;Passion Dance&quot; here he shows just how hard he can swing on a blues. Ron is playing with complete attitude too which gives McCoy the freedom to explore harmonically while keeping things grounded. Joe also takes the opportunity to play with his characteristic wolf notes and &quot;outside&quot; playing, it is perhaps one of the best solos he&#39;s taken and with his repertoire that is really saying something. . While the 2 tunes outlined here are fairly up-tempo and wild, this album also features 2 beautiful ballads. I find the modal paradigm really lends itself to ballads - it is very easy to create a &quot;mood&quot; and give the piece some character. On this album we have &quot;Contemplation&quot; and &quot;Search for Peace&quot; both of which are fantastic example of hard-bop ballads. Overall you cannot go wrong with any track on this album each one is a classic. This makes, in my opinion, &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; absolutely essential listening for anybody interested in jazz. .",

            "title": "Burn and Assembly Izuba",
            "content": "This week we have the last of my current batch of Assembly roasted coffee in the form of Izuba a washed Bourbon varietal from Burundi. To those familiar with previous blog posts may be having a sense of deja-vu at this point: Burndi as an origin has featured multiple times, many of the coffees featured are washed process and of course Assembly is a reliable blog favourite. . As regular readers will know, Assembly decorate each coffee with a &quot;swirl&quot; which somewhat reflects the flavour profile of the coffee for this coffee we have: . . This coffee gets its name from the washing station where it was processed. The Izuba washing station is located in the city of Kayanza within the Kayanza province in the north of the country, not too far from the border with Rwanda. Typically specialty coffees are named after the &quot;smallest&quot; identifiable characteristic - in this case the coffee is named after the washing station since this coffee is made up of many small lots of local farms. In contrast other coffees could be named after a particular farm (e.g. in the Americas typically you&#39;ll see &quot;Finca ....&quot; - the Spanish for farm). In very high end coffees you might see a farm name followed by a lot number (or farm name followed by a varietal) which denotes a specific part of a specific farm. In cheaper coffees you might only see a region name (e.g. Ethiopia Sidamo) since there is no addtional provenance available. In (typically non specialty grade) you&#39;ll simply get a country name or sometimes not even that! But there is a slight caveat here: some roasters like to name their coffees, essentially as a form of branding, that have nothing to do with the farm/coffee itself. However you can usually find out the details by going onto the roasters website or provided literature with the coffee. . A big part of the specialty coffee movement is transparanency so generally the more detailed the better! However this has essentially nothing to do with quality in the cup, you might find a coffee from a very precise lot of a farm and have all the information in the world but still not particularly enjoy the taste. As always these &quot;sign posts&quot; should help you get a feel for whether a roaster is offering quality specialty grade or whether they care about their product, but not much more than that. At the end of the day it&#39;s your taste preferences that matter, there are plenty of objectively high quality roasters who just don&#39;t do it for me (and as a result will not feature on this blog!) . Enough blabbering on; onto the coffee itself. Upon grinding the dry aroma of this coffee gives off a fruity vibe as you often expect from washed African coffees. Likely owing to its location it certainly shares a similarity to a Rwandan coffee in terms of aroma. I would describe the fruit note as being quite heavy with a dark grape or plum. There is also a faint caramel/fudge note but it doesn&#39;t immediately jump out. Overall it is not an aroma monster but is very pleasant, refined and elegant. As usual diving into a filter coffee (prepared in my usual way). First thing I notice is red wine, I almost always get this note with Burundi coffees it seems. On the taste notes assembly say &quot;Pomegranate&quot; which I think is the same note, but for me it is more wine-y owing to the heavy nature of this coffee and I did not have the refreshing &quot;zing&quot; I associate with a pomegranate. It is like a full bodied oaky red, very satisfying. There are complexities there too however, there is certainly some faint florals that jump in and out as the cup cools. A little hard to put your finger on exactly what type of floral but it&#39;s certainly there. The sweetness comes through in the form of fudge, I think owing to the texture too. For a washed coffee it is a &quot;big&quot; feeling coffee, not necessarily in terms of mouthfeel but certainly in body - it tastes huge. On the acidity scale I would say this is a medium (at least for a washed African coffee) there&#39;s certainly some there but it&#39;s not a &quot;screw your face up - battery acid&quot; coffee. . Moving onto the espresso: this coffee was an absolute delight to dial in. I found it unbelievably forgiving, it was basically impossible to pull anything less than great on my set up. I eventually settled on a very &quot;typical&quot; 1:2 ratio in around 27s - for a filter roasted washed African this is not typical. I found that pulling like this maintained the &quot;huge&quot; feeling and gave enough mouthfeel to be really enjoyable. Pulling longer was still good but I lost a bit of texture and the espresso was already sweet enough in the shorter pull so it didn&#39;t offer much improvement there. In the cup I found that the fudge/toffee notes jumped out a bit more but the red wine was still the main note for me. The subtle florals I picked out in the filter were totally overpowered in the espresso and I couldn&#39;t find them at all. I did notice more of a stone fruit vibe in the espresso: most likely a plum flavour. But again this was subtle. . Overall I think I prefered this coffee as an espresso to a filter, both were great but I enjoyed the amped up mouthfeel of the espresso given the heavy flavour profile. This is a coffee that can work as both an &quot;every day&quot; drinker and a &quot;special treat&quot; when you want to savour the tastes and really dig into a flavour profile. As with pretty much every Assembly roast: another standout coffee. I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be too long before I order another batch from Assembly they&#39;re just so reliable and seem to pick coffees that just work for me. . For this weeks jazz I&#39;m picking an album from 2013. The band is the Mercury prize nominated, Mobo award winning - British jazz quartet: &quot;Sons of Kemet&quot; - with their debut album &quot;Burn&quot;. . . This album comes completely from left-field and is certainly unique. You could describe this as being part of the &quot;hipster jazz&quot; movement which I feel is a little unfair, while the sound may attract the hipster crowd it has more depth and creativity than others tarred with this brush. It should appeal to &quot;serious&quot; jazz fans too. Let&#39;s start with the personnel: . Shabaka Hutchings - Sax | Oren Marshall - Tuba | Tom Skinner - Drums | Seb Rochford - Drums | . (There is also a small electric guitar cameo on 2 of the tracks but the band itself is composed of these 4 members). . This is a truly bizarre lineup for a band, there are no &quot;harmony&quot; instruments so of course the focus will be on melodic and rhythmic ideas opposed to harmonic ones. The tuba takes the role of &quot;bass&quot; which is kind of an interesting sound in itself as it is not something you see often, especially in small band. Then of course the dual drums, reading this you may think that the drumming duties are split with Tom appearing on some tracks and Seb on others - but you would be wrong: the Sons of Kemet sound depends on 2 drummers working together. . The band leader is Shabaka Hutchings. He leads a number of other projects and has also frequently appeared as a sideman. Shabaka does not just follow the &quot;traditional&quot; jazz sound and takes great influence from electronic and hip-hop styles. His projects often feel just as home in a nightclub as they do a jazz club. &quot;Sons of Kemet&quot; is no exception. &quot;Burn&quot; has two main modes: the first I would describe as &quot;post-apocolyptic rave music&quot; and the second as &quot;spiritual contemplation&quot;. . The track &quot;Inner Babylon&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog post) is an example of the &quot;post-apocolyptic rave&quot; sound. To me it always brings images of a party in a burnt out city. I had the fortune of seeing this band play live numerous times after this album was released and there was certainly a party atmosphere - it was a unique experience for a jazz gig. I remember one in particular at the Barbican concert hall where they were supporting &quot;Mehliana&quot; (the Brad Mehldau - Mark Guiliana fusion collaboration project). &quot;Sons of Kemet&quot; totally blew the crowd away, to the point that &quot;Mehliana&quot; seemed totally tame and a bit boring, I remember the crowd even heckling Brad a few times during the show... Moral of the story: pick your support acts carefully and make sure they don&#39;t show you up! Another track I am particularly fond of on the album is &quot;The Godfather&quot;. There is a Hasidic influenceon the melodies that I find intriguing juxtaposed against the trance rhythm section. I&#39;ve always found the Hasidic musical traditions to be interesting and something I have to dig into further. . We don&#39;t often talk about record engineering or production on this blog much, owing to a complete lack of knowledge on part of the author, but it is worth mentioning here. With a small band like this with a rather limited musical range it is easy for a record to sound &quot;small&quot;. This is not the case here, the album has an absolutely huge sound! If you&#39;re not paying attention you easily forget there are only 4 musicians playing. This is not through the use of overdubs or multi-tracking, near enough the entire album is free of this and is recorded &quot;live&quot;. Instead there is the rather ingenious use of tape echo and reverb to give the illusion of a larger soundscape. This is not done in a cynical way that sounds artifical however, you don&#39;t really notice it is there. Production duties for this album fell to Seb Rochford - one of the drummers in the band and he should be commended for the work he did here. Without this I don&#39;t think the album would have half the impact it does. (Unfortunately the youtube compression does this no favours, I&#39;d recommend getting the album from alternate sources for the best experience, it is worth it!) . Seb is one of my favourite &quot;modern&quot; jazz drummers, everything he touches seems to be made better by his presence. In the jazz world you may have heard him through his band &quot;Polar Bear&quot; (another Mercury prize nominee) or playing with &quot;Acoustic Ladyland&quot;, &quot;Basquiat Strings&quot; or &quot;Andy Shepherd&quot;. He typically takes a wide range of influences from rock, electronic and world music in his jazz playing which elevates the music. However he also does session work for rock/pop acts and appeared on some of the early &quot;Babyshambles&quot; records/gigs with Pete Doherty. I&#39;ve met Seb a couple of times at gigs and he is also a really nice guy. . On the tuba side we have Oren Marshall, before &quot;Sons of Kemet&quot; I knew of him but hadn&#39;t really listened to much of him. On this album he made such an impression I looked at more of his stuff, he has a very interesting sound. If you see him perfom live you may also see him play a custom made &quot;Orenophone&quot; a modified tuba of his own design: . . Following the release of this album Seb and Oren subsequently left the band, personally I feel a lot of the magic went with them and to be honest I&#39;ve not really enjoyed their subsequent releases. But this does not take away from &quot;Burn&quot;. . To finish I&#39;ll share one more tune off the album: a cover of Boney-M: &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot;. It is unlikely you&#39;ve ever heard this track covered in this way. While Boney-M&#39;s version is rather cheesy and dated by todays standards; this version is full of spirituality and contemplation. I feel this forms a deeper connection with the intended meaning behind the song. It is a really fantastic track and a nice contrast to some of the more energetic cuts on the album. .",

            "title": "A Go Go and Assembly Monteverde",
            "content": "This week we are sticking with Assembly coffee roasters in Brixton, London. This time we move away from Africa through to South America and Colombia to be exact. The coffee is called &quot;Monteverde&quot; which is the name of the farm located in the Andean region in the Tolima department - in the centre west of the county and just west of Bogota. . As regular readers will know, Assembly decorate each coffee with a &quot;swirl&quot; which somewhat reflects the flavour profile of the coffee for this coffee we have: . . Perhaps the most &quot;interesting&quot; part of this coffee is its processing method, described by Assembly as &quot;anaerobic&quot;. The coffee undergoes a 2 stage fermentation anaerobic fermentation process where the temperature is carefully controlled between 19 and 23 celcius. The second stage is a 48 hour aerobic temperature and pH controlled fermentation. Reported to be a similar technique to Yemeni producers. I have seen these sorts of process also called &quot;semi-anaerobic&quot; and other names. This is what I would consider an &quot;experimental&quot; processing method compared to the more typical washed/natural/honey type processes we are more accustomed to. Personally I find these methods hit and miss, some of them can be great and produce interesting and complex cups but many leave me feeling cold, I find them a bit &quot;hollow&quot; (for lack of a better word) in an almost &quot;decaf&quot; sort of way. They can be intense flavour wise but unbalanced and for me not that enjoyable. As such I don&#39;t hunt out these sort of coffees. . In terms of varietal this coffee is a Caturra. This varietal is very prevelant around the Americas and represents a natural mutation of the Bourbon varietal. It is known for fairly good cup quality and yield but is considered susceptible to both leaf rust and pests. It is also a parent varietal to many hybrid or mutated varietals such as Catimor (cross with a Timor), Castillo, and others which typically offer better resistance to leaf rust and pests. . Moving onto the coffee itself. The first thing I notice is the beans have a slighlty &quot;oily&quot; look to them - not in an &quot;italian roast&quot; sort of way (these beans are definitely a light roast). It is slighlty strange and not something I really see in the sort of beans I buy, I wonder if it&#39;s a result of the particular processing? As a dry aroma we are treated to tropical fruits galore with this one - its a fruit salad in coffee form. Papaya, pineapple, mango, passion fruit - everything is there and it is a very intense experience. I found these beans a little odd as a grinding experience too, in my hand grinder for filter they almost had a &quot;spongy&quot; character. In the past I have experimented with microwaving beans prior to grinding and they have a similar texture. Very strange indeed. . As a filter the tropical fruits really carry though and it is just a fruit bomb. There is no other way to describe this coffee, big, punchy, bright but funky too. The acidity is fairly high in this one but there is a lot of sweetness too which acts to offset this. It also has a reasonably big mouthfeel and is almost syrupy. This is a very complex cup and one could spend a while trying to unpick everything in the cup. I did find it had a pretty &quot;linear&quot; heat profile though, in as much as the flavours do not evolve as the cup cools (at least very much). It does not have the &quot;hollow&quot; quality I sometimes associate with the experimental processing methods which is definitely a positive. Overall it is not the cleanest cup I&#39;ve ever had but for a cup with funk it is fairly clean. . Moving onto the espresso. The weird grinding continued for me here, I found this one a strange coffee to work with. I found you wouldn&#39;t get many fines at all until you hit a specific grind setting and then it produced an absolute boat ton of fines. This led to me adopting a very strange recipe for this coffee: 16.5g in to 50g out with the shot pulling in 14s. By most standards this would be considered a &quot;gusher&quot; and a failed shot, if I saw a cafe pulling a shot like this I would likely walk away thinking they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. But for me this just works with this coffee, going to a more &quot;traditional&quot; shot profile led to a slight acrid aftertaste note that I did not care for. One might expect a shot pulled like this to be extremely sour but this was not the case and the sweetness meant it was fairly balanced. At around a 1:3 ratio one might expect to have a very watery thin mouthfeel too, again not the case and it was quite thick and luxurious with a thick crema too. The flavour profile is similar to the filter: an absolute fruit bomb with a hint of funk. A very interesting and delcious shot of espresso. . This weeks jazz comes courtesy of John Scofield, in the form of his 1998 album &quot;A Go Go&quot;: . . This album marks his first collaboration with Medeski, Martin and Wood (MMW) with whom he has recorded 4 albums - after this album they decided to record under the name: &quot;Medeski, Scofield, Martin and Wood&quot; (MSMW). The full album musician/instrument line-up is: . John Scofield â electric &amp; acoustic guitars, whistle | John Medeski â organ, Wurlitzer, clavinet, piano | Chris Wood â acoustic &amp; electric basses | Billy Martin â drums, tambourine | . Up to this point MMW had achieved a modest cult following but it wasn&#39;t until this album that they really made it &quot;big&quot;, following on from this they released a string of fairly commercially successful records (without Scofield) mostly in the &quot;jazz-funk&quot; space. They created their own &quot;scene&quot; and attracted new listeners to jazz. However in addition to their jazz-funk side they also had their feet firmly planted in the avant-garde working with John Zorn and were also heavily linked to the &quot;jam-band&quot; scene and a certain contingent of their fans would readily describe themselves as &quot;dead heads&quot; or &quot;phish phans&quot;. In addition to recording as a trio each member has numerous side projects and collaborations in genres from more straight ahead jazz, through pop, rock and hip-hop. . The title artist, and sole composer, on the album is John Scofield - Sco to his friends. John needs no introduction really, since the 1970s he has toured and recorded with many of the titans of jazz: Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Joe Henderson, Dave Liebman, Billy Cobham, Chet Baker, Paul Bley and many many more. In addition he has had a prolific career as a leader/solo artist with around 50 records to his name. If you were to ask people to list &quot;jazz guitarists&quot; it wouldn&#39;t be a long wait to hear Sco mentioned. &quot;A Go Go&quot; is likely to have a lot to do with this as commercially it is likely to be Sco&#39;s most successful release. . In the 1970s Sco was one of the first jazz players to use a distorted &quot;rock&quot; guitar sound, before this jazz guitarists had typically used large hollowbody guitars prone to feedback into clean guitar amps. As fusion came in this changed and many opted for a distorted sound - in this respect Sco was very influencial. You can argue over who the first was to do this but for me the &quot;Scofield tone&quot; is something that many tried to imitate (I find the secret being to pick very hard right next to the bridge to get his squealing cat sort of phrasing). His playing style however cannot be imitated. His style changed over the years but has always been distinctly Sco. Initially he played faster lines, but by &quot;A Go Go&quot; he slowed down significantly. His playing is all about &quot;laziness&quot; and being as far behind the beat as possible while still being in good time. The lines themselves tend to be fairly outside but the phrasing and timing presents them in a way that you sometimes don&#39;t notice. It is something that is very hard to do, I&#39;ve heard many players do &quot;Scofield impressions&quot; but very few (if any) actually nail what he&#39;s doing. I once heard him described as: &quot;He knows so much music it just falls out of him&quot; - which I feel is an apt description for his playing style. . On to the album itself: the album has a very strong &quot;jam-band&quot; feel from the MMW supporting cast, with more than a hint of jazz-funk throughout. As with many MMW projects the music has a &quot;get up and dance&quot; feel, even when the music itself can be fairly complex and at times intense and gnarly. Mostly though it just feels like four friends playing music together and we are just fortunate there was a tape there to capture the moment. The album kicks off with the title track &quot;A Go Go&quot; (embedded above). This track is a good signpost of what is to come on the album. It has a sort of mysterious and eerie vibe, but at the same time funky and jovial. The solos are a contrast to this where both Johns play with an attitude and swagger. There are also hints of &quot;The Meters&quot; in certain parts - an influence that seems to crop up on many tracks on the album. The fifth track on the album &quot;Jeep on 35&quot; is perhaps the most sophisticated tune on the album. I guess you&#39;d describe it a having a &quot;fusion&quot; sound from the 1970s but that would be doing the tune a disservice. Although a &quot;jam-band&quot; feel there are many different parts and sections in the composition. Given the title and easy laid-back vibe this seems a tailor made soundtrack for a summer road trip. Sco&#39;s solo on this piece in particular is a perfect case study in his &quot;behind the beat&quot; or &quot;lazy&quot; soloing style that is so hard to imitate. . Another high point on the album for me is &quot;Green Tea&quot;: Here the tempo is brought right down from some of the higher energy funk that surround it on the album. All the music featured walks the narrow line between extremely &quot;relaxed&quot; music and extremely &quot;sophisticated&quot; - something that is very hard to do well. One of the real selling points of this album is just how strong every track is. If I were to re-write this entire post again I could choose any of the other tune to write about. . So if you want some funky coffee then hunt down a bag of Monteverde, if you want some funky jazz hunt down a copy of &quot;A Go Go&quot;. .",

            "title": "Cornbread and Assembly Shyira",
            "content": "This week we&#39;re going to keep the blog post tight since I have been pretty busy and haven&#39;t had a lot of time to plan what I&#39;m going to write. We are heading back to our friends at Assembly Coffee Roasters located in Brixton London. The coffee in question is called Shyira and is a red-bourbon varietal from Rwanda. Shyira is the name of the mill where the coffee is processed, it is located in the Nyabihu region of the country which shares a border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to the north. . Earlier this year (May 7th 2020) Shyira and surrounding areas were subject to rather catastrophic landslides. As a result Assembly have very kindly decided to donate all profits from the sale of this coffee to the relief fund: https://www.gofundme.com/f/Rwandan-landslide - if you would like to help feel free to donate to the page or buy a bag of the coffee at: https://assemblycoffee.co.uk/collections/buy-coffee/products/rwanda-shyira . As regular readers will know, Assembly decorate each coffee with a &quot;swirl&quot; which somewhat reflects the flavour profile of the coffee for this coffee we have: . . Moving swiftly on to the coffee itself: the dry aroma gives hints of caramel and a slight spice but the over-arching quality is vibrant and zingy with plenty of citrus fruits. From the moment you open the bag you know it&#39;s going to be in for a lot of bright acidity here. As is customary in this blog we start with a filter coffee: the flavour notes on the bag are &quot;pink grapefruit&quot;, &quot;lemonade&quot; and &quot;vibrant&quot; - and I certainly couldn&#39;t think of a better description than that, for me that is right on the money. The grapefruit is very much in your face from the getgo, the lemonade appears as a sweetness to balance but there is also an almost carbonated vibe to the coffee (not in as much as it&#39;s actually fizzy, but as a flavour as you get with carbonated water/drinks). Although acidity is the focus it is not over-bearing and is not like drinking vinegar at all, it is very well balanced. This is a truly expertly roasted coffee. In terms of mouthfeel and body it is relatively thin but not devoid of any body. The aftertaste is clean and fairly shortlived. Overall extremely enjoyable as a filter, one I very sadly miss now the bag is finished. . One might assume with a light roast filter coffee that is very acidity focussed this would be an absolute nightmare to dial in as an espresso, I did not find this to be the case at all. It is surprisingly forgiving and I didn&#39;t have a single shot that was less than &quot;very good&quot; even when dialing in. I ultimately settled for a fairly &quot;traditional&quot; recipe of around a 2.2:1 ratio in about 27s. Usually a pull quite a bit longer than this for a lighter filter roast but with this one it could hold together at a shorter ratio and it didn&#39;t get too overbearing. It does like higher temperatures though and I was close to maxing out my machines temperature to get this shot. The flavour notes in the espresso are very much like in the filter, the grapefruit is the main quality and the lemonade is a little more subdued. The caramel, brown sugar sort of note that was picked up in the dry aroma rears its head in the espresso too, balancing the more wild grapefruit flavours. Being a relatively short shot we do get some body, but it&#39;s more silky than heavy. As before the aftertaste is relatively shortlived but is very clean and crisp. Just as with the filter this was very enjoyable and will be missed. . Even without the donation to the landslide appeal I would say this coffee is worth tasting, given you can do some good and enjoy a great coffee I&#39;d suggest buying a bag of this is a no-brainer. . To pair with this great coffee we are going to have Cornbread. Not the southern US delicacy (although I&#39;m sure it would go fantastically well with the coffee) but the 1967 Blue Note classic recorded by Lee Morgan. . . Lee Morgan has featured on the blog before but never as a leader. He was, and still is, one of the heavyweights of the jazz world. Many considered him to be the next &quot;flag bearer&quot; of the genre before his life was cut tragically short. Netflix (in the UK at least) currently has a brilliant documentary from 2016 called: &quot;I Called Him Morgan&quot; available, if you do not know the Lee Morgan story I strongly suggest you add it to your list of things to watch. It features interviews from some big names (most notably Wayne Shorter). Be warned it is quite a sad and tragic story, so don&#39;t go in expecting lemon drops and rainbows. . . Lee&#39;s trumpet sound for me was always clean, clear and powerful and he always played with authority. This didn&#39;t go unnoticed and he joined Dizzy Gillespie&#39;s big band and just 18 years old. Shortly afterwards appearing on &quot;Blue Train&quot; by John Coltrane and later went on to be an integral member of Art Blakey&#39;s Jazz Messengers. Progressing from being &quot;just&quot; a sideman Morgan moved on to release records under his own name as a leader, some are rightly regarded as all time classics and feature heavily in &quot;best selling&quot; album lists. . The personnel on Cornbread is: . Lee Morgan â Trumpet | Herbie Hancock â Piano | Billy Higgins â Drums | Jackie McLean â Alto sax | Hank Mobley â Tenor sax | Larry Ridley â Bass | . As with many albums on this blog any one of these artists can (and in most cases have) released successful albums under their own name. Herbie of course needs no introduction and we saw Mobley in action a few posts back - he and Lee had a particularly prolific period of collaboration and have appeared on many albums together. They seem particularly well suited to each other as musicians and seem to have a near perfect sense of what the other is trying to achieve. Jackie McLean is probably a name you&#39;d more likely associate with the avant-garde/free side of jazz (or perhaps &quot;fusion&quot;) - but on Cornbread we are all about the hard-bop and soul-jazz and he fits perfectly in this group also. . The album kicks off with the title track (embedded at the start of this post). Within a matter of seconds it is clear that this album will be something special, you can hear the slight nervous energy and tension primed and waiting to be released. You can hear the obvious influence of Herbie in the arrangement - you feel as though this could easily feature on &quot;Takin Off&quot; or any of his other early works. There is a certain amount of Mobley in the DNA of the track too - but of course it is all about Lee Morgan. Lee takes the first solo on the track and throws it down, a lot of swagger and almost arrogance to what he&#39;s playing. As a listener it puts you completely at ease as you feel you&#39;re in safe hands. While it&#39;s not particularly &quot;outside&quot; in its approach that does not equate to &quot;harmonically boring&quot; and there&#39;s a lot to get excited about. Another album highlight (for me) is the 3rd track &quot;Ceora&quot; - a beautiful ballad. I find ballads to be a real test for jazz artists, many fall down the trap of overplaying and throwing their ego at a tune. Others end up playing too &quot;inside&quot; and it just ends up a snooze-fest. Not here however, not only is the tune itself brilliantly written the solos are simply sublime. Lee in particular absolutely kills it with his solo; daring, interesting yet still simple and beautiful. Ballads are possibly not the first thing you think of when you here the &quot;Lee Morgan&quot; name but he is simply fantastic on this one. Herbie too takes a superb slow burning solo with real passion. . Perhaps the greatest thing about this album is the sheer consistency. From start to finish every single track is fantastic and worthy of note. From the slightly sombre standard &quot;Ill Wind&quot; (the only track not composed by Morgan on the album) or the hard-bop soul-jazz swinging groove of &quot;Most Like Lee&quot;. . The second track on the album is &quot;Our Man Higgins&quot; - penned as a reflection on drummer Billy Higgins (a legend in his own right). It is perhaps the most interesting of the tunes on this album, it relies heavily on chromaticism and is essentially a bridge between the &quot;free&quot; sound and the hard-bop sound. Higgins himself and of course McLean are well versed in the free side whereas Morgan and Mobley are more associated with the hard-bop side. This makes for some interesting tension throughout the piece as it sways between the styles depending on the soloist. . We have covered a lot of Blue Note records on this blog so far, and for good reason - they are on the whole fantastic. But one piece of the puzzle we have overlooked so far is Rudy Van Gelder the sound engineer. I bring this up in this post because Cornbread is such a fantastic sounding album, it has the quintessential &quot;hard-bop&quot; sound which helps raise the music that much more. . If there were such a thing as a list of &quot;essential&quot; jazz albums this is certainly one I would feature. If you are looking for some jazz to listen to you can do much worse than give this one 40 minutes of your time. .",

            "title": "Elder Don and Round Hill Mbirizi",
            "content": "This week we are sticking with the Round Hill Roastery with a filter roast from Burundi - an origin that has featured on the blog a few times in the past. This particular example is a washed Bourbon varietal, the coffee takes its name after the washing station where it was processed: Mbirizi. It is located in the north of the country close to the border with Rwanda. As far as I can tell this one has an SCA score of 87 and so we expect some quality in this cup! . As in the previous post this coffee arrived in brown paper packaging instead of the usual baby blue you would expect from a Round Hill filter roast. As I stated I was never much of a fan of the blue/pink packaging so this was a welcome change. Yesterday however Round Hill announced a new packaging style (in the usual blue/pink colourways) - and I have to say I like it much more: . . This gives the coffee a more modern and clean look which I really like. I&#39;m a firm believer that packaging matters a lot with coffees, the moment you get the bag in your hand you subconciously begin to develop expectations. If the bag is not aesthetically pleasing or looks &quot;amateur&quot; it is hard to get rid of this when it comes round to tasting the coffee itself. So I am very happy to see this new packaging and will look forward to my next Round Hill order to see how it looks &quot;in the flesh&quot;. . In a similar way I also believe that the drinking vessel you use makes a big difference to how you perceive your coffee. I have tried a wide variety of cups for filter and demitasse for espresso and for me a few things seem to make a real difference. Firstly for filter I prefer a &quot;cup&quot; style with no handle as opposed to a mug, the hand warming sensation of grabbing a cup adds to the overall experience and feels more interactive. Secondly in terms of shape I tend to gravitate towards taller, thinner cups instead of shorter, squatter cups. The thin and tall nature of the cup means you have to tilt your head back slightly further to take a sip and so the aromatics can flow into the nostrils better, the sharper radius of the cup also means the coffee does not fill the mouth quite as much with each sip - you sacrifice a &quot;big mouthfeel&quot; but I find it easier to pick out more delicate acidic notes which are the ones I gravitate towards. I also like a thinner rim to drink from as an experience - this also helps the coffee cool quicker since there&#39;s less thermal mass. In terms of demitasse I go for much the same qualities really, although it is hard to find many thinner rim espresso cups since most want to keep the beverage hot for longer. Personally I&#39;d rather the sensation of drinking from the thin rim in the knowledge I have to drink it quicker (since it&#39;s an espresso how long will it stick around anyway?) I also find sizing an issue with demitasse, many are larger than I would like since (I assume) they are designed in a way that allows you to make a macchiato/cortardo/etc. but I never bother with those. There is something upsetting about seeing an espresso barely make its way halfway up a cup! In terms of material I do not enjoy glass very much, although it is great to see the definition of the crema or clarity of the filter in them, so am usually looking for ceramic/porcelain. The &quot;earthenware&quot; style cups are nice to hold but again I do not like the drinking experience quite as much. And of course a paper takeaway cup is about the worst experience one can have, even without thinking about the environmental implication. But this is all personal preference so I&#39;d suggest just trying a few different things and seeing what works for you and sometimes you may have recieved a cup as a gift and so you associate it with a loved one, in which case none of the &quot;technical&quot; stuff matters! . Moving onto the coffee itself: as usual starting with the filter. This coffee is one of the most sensitive to temperature I think I&#39;ve ever seen. First cup I made I took the first sip while it was still quite hot and thought I had made a big mistake. There was no flavour definition and it was just kind of muddled. However letting it cool down a few degrees and it really comes alive. The cup is fairly complex, there are orange and grapefruit citrus flavours there, I notice raspberries too and an almost red-wine like vibe to the whole thing. In the aftertaste I&#39;m left with a tea-like floral quality that is very clean. Very nice and super interesting yet surprisingly easy to drink too. Unfortunately I find if it cools too much it starts to deteriorate and lose balance, so there&#39;s a relatively narrow temperature window for this coffee for me. I guess this would be a perfect coffee to use with a temperature controlled ember mug! As an espresso this coffee is an interesting one, based on the filter I was convinced I needed to use my &quot;typical&quot; filter roast espresso style, quick hot long pulls, but this wasn&#39;t right. By no means unpleasant but it seemed to lack a bit of punch. I dialed back to something closer to a &quot;traditional&quot; recipe and it really came alive. The red wine-y thing really jumped out at first, the citrus flavours were a little muted but that same aftertaste that I liked in the filter was still there - in fact it was a more intense aftertaste in the espresso which was certainly welcomed. Overall I enjoyed this one a lot and it is certainly quirky, I imagine with more time to play around I could uncover some more interesting things about this coffee. . Moving swiftly onto this weeks jazz. This week has been a busy one in JazzCoffeeStuff HQ and so I&#39;ve been craving simplicity in the music I&#39;ve been listening to. One place I like to go for simplicity is the Blue Note &quot;Soul Jazz&quot; movement of the 1960s (which we have visited before with Lou Donaldson). In digging through the archives I re-discovered an oft-overlooked artist: Don Wilkerson. After much deliberation I decided to settle on the album &quot;Elder Don&quot; (but don&#39;t ask me tomorrow or I&#39;ll pick a different one from his trio of Blue Note recordings). . . Don Wilkerson is not really a &quot;name&quot; in jazz, I would go as far as to say even some hardened jazz fans might not even recognise the name. He has very limited recorded output, he has 3 records on Blue Note (&quot;Elder Don&quot;, &quot;Preach Brother&quot; and &quot;Shoutin&#39;&quot;) and an earlier record on Riverside (&quot;Texas Twister&quot;). However it is highly likely you will have heard him play: he recorded sax solos on some of Ray Charles biggest hits such as &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot;. He is known for a powerful and confident tenor sound. This is about the limits of my knowledge about him, as I say he&#39;s very underappreciated. . The line up on &quot;Elder Don&quot; is: . Don Wilkerson - tenor saxophone | John Acea - piano | Grant Green - guitar | Lloyd Trotman - bass | Willie Bobo - drums | . Who apart from Green (and maybe Bobo) are not what you would call &quot;big names&quot; in jazz. In fact I would struggle to name any other recrdings featuring Acea or Trotman at all. This doesn&#39;t matter however since on this album they are great. . Embedded above is the 3rd track, closing side A of the record called &quot;Scrappy&quot;, it is probably the most &quot;hard bop&quot; this record gets. The main melody comprising of a cool doubled line between Wilkerson and Green. The Wilkerson powerful tenor sound is there throughout his solo which is relatively simple melodically and harmonically but packs a punch. This is followed by a typical Grant Green masterclass in jazzy-blues. As a guitarist myself I&#39;ve always respected the laid-back approch Green has, it&#39;s very easy for a guitarist to get &quot;too excited&quot; and throw too many notes around but Green never does this. I&#39;m also a big fan of his guitar tone, many jazz guitarists have pretty questionable tone in my experience but Green&#39;s is always great - punchy and throaty sounding. I&#39;m not sure but it sounds like he&#39;s using his Gibson 330 on this record. . Despite &quot;just&quot; being a soul-jazz record &quot;Elder Don&quot; actually covers a lot of ground. The opening track &quot;SeÃ±orita Eula&quot;, as the name suggests takes a latin influence to the soul-jazz or hard-bop sound. The main left hand riff of Acea also has a strong Professor Longhair influence to it. The record thus starts with a celebratory party atmosphere. The latin influence moves to Cuba in the 2nd track &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot; - these two tunes leaning into the Willie Bobo wheelhouse which gives a feeling of authenticity. The final track on the album &quot;Poor Butterfly&quot; is a soft slow ballad, very different from the preceeding tracks and gives the album some depth. My choice pick on the album however is &quot;Lone Star Shuffle&quot;. As the name suggests this is a simple blues shuffle. As much as I love sophisticated jazz harmony sometimes a basic blues played with attitude is all you need. Both Wilkerson and Green are totally at home playing a shuffle, their playing will not blow you away with sophistication or complexity but it has its place. . Overall the album is probably not a &quot;must listen, all time classic&quot; that you need to own in your collection. It does serve a purpose however when you don&#39;t want to think too much or perhaps you just need something on in the background there are certainly worse records to serve that purpose. There is often a bit of jazz snobbery whereby only the most complicated, sophisticated and groundbreaking records/artists get respect - but for me there&#39;s a time and place for the less adventurous stuff too. .",

            "title": "Angel Song and Round Hill Samii Nensebo Refisa",
            "content": "This week we are heading back to another favourite roaster of this blog: Round Hill Coffee Roasters located in Bath, England. Round Hill have long been one of my dependable roasters - it&#39;s rare I have coffees anything less than &quot;good&quot; from them. I was particuarly excited for this weeks coffee since it is a washed Ethiopian which is my favourite origin/processing combination. . The coffee is called: &quot;Samii Nensebo Refisa #3&quot; and, as always, I opted for the filter roast despite using the coffee for espresso also. Refisa is the name of the washing station where the coffee has been processed. Samii is a classifier you see on many washed Ethiopian coffees, it is essentially a flavour description that denotes the coffee in question has a strong &quot;floral&quot; element to its flavour profile. Nensebo is a region located in the south-west corner of Ethiopia. This coffee scored a cupping score of 88 which is very high for a &quot;normal&quot; non-competition grade/gesha/the like (but recall from before that we shouldn&#39;t rely too heavily on cupping scores when choosing coffees). The varietals are listed as Wolisho and Krume - it is so nice to finally be able to list varietals on an Ethiopian coffee and not simply rely on the tired old &quot;heirloom varietal&quot; to describe them. Unfortunately however there is currently very little information out there (as of yet) about the qualities of the individual varietals and I have not yet had a large enough sample to really draw any conclusions about them. . Moving onto getting this coffee into my cup! The dry aroma of the beans for me is quite spicy, a warming ginger-y sort of spice. But the more typical Ethiopian florals, tea and stone fruits are there too. A good dry aroma does not always lead to a good cup but in my experience a bad dry aroma never leads to a good cup - so at least we&#39;re starting on the right track. As usual starting with my usual filter with Chemex papers: first impression is this coffee is as clean as they come. No hint of any &quot;roasty&quot; notes (that never happens with Round Hill in my experience) and there are no &quot;dirty&quot; tastes at all (sometimes a bit of dirt can be nice however). A real test of a coffee, in my opinion, is how well it holds together as it cools and this one takes you on a journey. It starts off being a bit &quot;fizzy&quot; and bright - the note on the bag is &quot;lemon sherbert&quot; which I don&#39;t fundamentally disagree with. For me it is more like a really crisp lemonade however. As the cup cools the florals come out to play and the cup gets super complex and interesting, I would say the most apt descriptor for this stage would be &quot;candied lavendar&quot; at least that is what I think of when drinking it. As it cools down a little more it turns into juicy round peaches and sweet iced tea to finish. I&#39;m not sure if it takes on another transformation as it gets even cooler it has never stuck around long enough for me to tell. As a filter it is everything you want in a washed Ethiopian. . Before talking about the espresso I&#39;m going to take a bit of a detour and talk about a very unglamorous part of espresso machine ownership: the cleaning. One of the biggest mistakes I see new home-baristas making (second only to using bad water) is not keeping the machine clean enough. It is basically impossible to &quot;clean too much&quot; and the more you keep the internals clean the more you will be rewarded in the cup and ultimately the longer the life of your machine. I am fortunate enough to own a Londinium R spring loaded lever machine which makes the cleaning ritual that much easier, back-flushing is not a thing in a lever machine (in fact you&#39;ll cause major damage if you try). Basically &quot;all&quot; I have to do is remove the screen and basket to soak in some coffee cleaner (I like Cafetto brand), raise the piston and use some of the coffee cleaner on a paper towel to scrub clean the chamber. Give everything a good scrub with a soft brush (I use an old toothbrush) and rinse everything very well and that&#39;s all that&#39;s really needed. I have to say it is my favourite part of owning this machine. I make sure I do this after every 4-6 shots pulled and between each shot I use an Espazolla group head cleaner to wash off any loose coffee grounds that may be stuck to the screen. . . If all this sounds like too much work (and there is much more to do on a &quot;normal&quot; machine) then you probably don&#39;t want to get into the home espresso game. There is nothing worse than a dirty machine and you will notice it (or you will after you clean and realise how disgusting the taste was before!) As an aside it&#39;s a good way to judge a cafe, if you&#39;re sitting in for more than 15mins or so and you haven&#39;t seen them clean the machine it&#39;s probably time to find a new cafe! In most of the best cafes you&#39;ll probably see a timer stuck next to each group counting down, this is a reminder for the baristas that it&#39;s time to clean the machine again. I know some cafes use different ways of doing this but the timer is the most common in my experience. . With a nice clean machine lets move onto putting Samii Nensebo Refisa through its paces as an espresso. I found this coffee to live a bit on a knife edge, to get a really great espresso required great care in dialing in and subsequently minor adjustments every day to keep it in tip top form. If you don&#39;t nail it you still end up with a tasty drink but it&#39;s just a bit flat flavour wise but when you nail it you&#39;re handsomely rewarded. As a filter roast, and a reasonably light one at that, my usual dial in &quot;rules&quot; applied. Keep everything hot and pull fast was the name of the day. I ended up with a 2.9:1 ratio in 21s as my preferred recipe for my setup/water. As you would expect with such a long pull there isn&#39;t a whole lot of body in the cup but I don&#39;t mind that. By giving up the body we get treated to a really complex espresso, if you enjoy picking out flavours you can have a field day. That spicy note from the dry aroma sits in the background, which is interesting since I didn&#39;t pick it up at all in the filter. It&#39;s quite hard for florals to come through in an espresso, a lot of the time they get overpowered by other more dominant flavours. Not in this case though, the florals are noticable. The major flavour note for me is that peach-tea quality, it keeps things very sweet and easy to drink since it balances the acidity nicely. It is one worth battling with for the &quot;god shots&quot; you can get out of it. I should say they also offer this as an espresso roast which I&#39;m sure is much easier to dial in for those that don&#39;t want to battle. . For our jazz this week we are looking at a 1997 album from Kenny Wheeler on the ECM record label called: &quot;Angel Song&quot;. . . Let&#39;s start by looking at the line up: . Kenny Wheeler - Trumpet, Flugelhorn | Lee Konitz - Alto Saxophone | Dave Holland - Double-Bass | Bill Frisell - Electric Guitar | . By whatever standard you care to use this is an &quot;all-star&quot; lineup. Each of these artists is worth writing a whole blog about by themselves. It is also interesting to note that this album does not feature any drums/percussion of any kind. It is all about the interaction between the musicians and allowing them to play off each other. It is a subtle album and to really find the beauty in it may take a few listens. Overall I consider it one of the gems on the ECM label. . Starting with the title artist Wheeler. He is perhaps best known as a composer/arranger and for me that is where his talents lied. Nobody could (nor can) compose like Wheeler, he is instantly recognisable. His compositions maintain an ambient, mystical quality with a kind of haunting beauty. When paired with the right musicians it can be spectacular, as on &quot;Angel Song&quot;. He also frequently played the flugelhorn which is my favourite instrument from a tonal/timbral perspective and works particularly well with his compositional voice. . Lee Konitz can only be described as a jazz legend, he had a fruitful career spanning over 70 years before he died earlier this year. He was a key contributor to &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; by Miles Davis and was a big figure in the whole &quot;cool&quot; movement. His style is very relaxed and lyrical, focussed very heavily on simple and pure melody. I was fortunate enough to see him perform a couple of years ago and he was still putting on a great show. There was a particular highlight where the band was playing &quot;Just Friends&quot; and after his solo Lee was clearly a little miffed so grabbed the guitarist (Jakob Bro) to one side and shouted at him: &quot;Why are you playing all that complicated stuff? Just play the damn tune!&quot; Which perfectly sums up the Konitz approach. . Holland essentially takes the place of the &quot;rhythm section&quot; in this band, typically playing quite simple driving bass-lines to keep things moving. For my money he is one of the best touring musicians out there to this day and I always try and get tickets if I can. His persona comes across as understated and effortless cool which comes across in the music, very confident without the need to shout about it. I was once at Ronnie Scott&#39;s waiting to be seated when Dave walked past into the club - the lady on the desk panicked having no idea who he was and ran to stop him and said: &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s a private club you&#39;re not allowed in here&quot; to which he replied: &quot;But I am the act!&quot; to much laughter in the queue. . As a guitarist, Bill Frisell is probably my biggest single influence. I find his comping style fascinating, he manages to do so much with so little. It&#39;s as if by holding back he holds up a mirror and the soloing musician ends up sounding even more like themselves. On this album this is really noticable since it is all about this interplay. Bill will never blow you away with chops or come at a tune with any ego, a lot of times you don&#39;t always notice what he is doing but if you removed his part a lot of the magic of a tune would be lost. . For reasons I don&#39;t understand this album has a pitfully low AllMusic review (2/5) - I&#39;m not sure if one of the musicians did something to the reviewer personally but it is baffling. This acts as a reminder not to focus on AllMusic ratings too much, as useful as it is as a resource. . Ordinarily in these blogs I like to embed a few tunes to talk about, unfortunately I am not able to do this here since ECM are particularly good at removing their music from youtube. But with an album like this it kind of doesn&#39;t matter, since it is such a moody, ethereal experience the album really needs to be enjoyed in 1 go. Embedded at the start of this post are the 2 opening tracks &quot;Nicolette&quot; and &quot;Present Past&quot; which should give you a good feeling of what is to come on the rest of the album (although the sound quality on youtube is particularly bad and not representive of the album itself). If you are after atmospheric, haunting beauty you could do much worse than give this one a listen. I find it a highly thought provoking and really warrants some attention to get the most out of it. Yet equally it doesn&#39;t fight for your attention so in that sense it could be used as a background soundtrack to the rest of your day. If I had to pick a single track as a favourite it would likely be the 4th: &quot;Unti&quot; which I find to be the perfect example of haunting, imperfect beauty. .",

            "title": "Roll Call and PLOT Gaturiri AA",
            "content": "This week we are staying with the fine people at PLOT coffee roastingre making their 5th appearance on this blog. This time we are making our first trip to Kenya through their Gaturiri AA coffee. . There was a period around 5 years ago when Kenyan coffees were the be all and end all. As soon as (UK) summer rolled round all the top London coffee shops had some sort of washed Kenyan on offer. They were treated as the high watermark of what specialty had to offer. Personally I never went crazy for Kenyan coffees, I like them a lot as a filter but I sometimes find their acidity can get a little too much in an espresso. This was especially true a few years ago when there was a few years where London coffee shops wanted to serve exceptionally bright and sour espresso shots, thankfully this trend has largely gone away and most places are roasting more developed and balanced Kenyan roasts these days. . As most Kenyan coffees this one is a washed process, recall from our previous blogs that washed (as the name suggests) involves washing the coffee cherry away from the seed. This leads to a cleaner tasting cup, it is generally &quot;easier&quot; to process coffee this way since you do not have to monitor fermentation or worry as much about how the coffee is drying. Finding a non-washed coffee from Kenya is quite difficult and you don&#39;t see them often, however I understand that certain farms are now experimenting with alternate processing techniques and these should be landing later this year, which will certainly be interesting to try! . The varietals in this coffee are SL28 and SL34. These are common varietals in Kenyan coffee. These varietals descend from the Bourbon genetic lineage. They are recognised as having some of the highest levels of cup quality of all varietals however they are also highly suceptible to pests and disease. These varietals also crop up in other origins such as Uganda or Malawi. The varietals were first discovered in the 1930s in Kenya by Scott Labs (hence the &quot;SL&quot; prefix) who were established by the colonial British government to aid agriculture within the region. The lab worked to characterize and classify the various coffee varietals in order to find those producing superior tastes but most importantly were also resistant to droughts. The two &quot;winners&quot; were SL28 and SL34. The former is considered to (typically) have a better cup quality and is better suited to higher altitude growing, SL34 is still considered very good in the cup but is able to be grown at lower altitudes. . Another common descriptor on Kenyan coffees is the &quot;AA&quot; designation (or &quot;AB&quot; etc.) This often gets interpreted as denoting the &quot;quality&quot; of the coffee but in reality it only refers to the size of the beans themselves. If the beans are of a certain size (which they determine by passing beans through a sieve) they are labelled AA, a different size and they are labelled as AB. This doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with quality whatsoever - think about many Ethiopian &quot;heirloom&quot; type varietals which are tiny yet have great cup quality! It is a myth that does seem to stick around however, I do wonder if certain producers/roasters use this to try and charge a higher premium! Outside of Kenya you rarely see bean size designations on coffees. . As is customary in this blog lets move onto tasting the coffee in question! Starting as usual in a filter we are treated to the characteristic &quot;Kenyan&quot; taste of blackerry and blackcurrant in spades. Kenyan coffees have this characteristic flavour that so few other coffees manage, if these flavours speak to you you&#39;ll definitely want to hunt down some Kenyan coffees. In addition to the blackberry quality this particular example combines a hibiscus like floral-fruity sweetness. It is not the most acidic coffee in this style I&#39;ve ever had and it&#39;s actually very drinkable. In terms of washed Kenyan coffees I&#39;d describe this as quite a mellow one, as it cools down the more delicate floral notes come out to play. This is one that really changes as it cools, if you leave it long enough to get fairly cold (if you can wait that long) - it manages to hold itself together where often a coffee can start to taste a bit rough. At this stage a kind of orange flavour begins to come through which is kind of neat. Moving onto the espresso, sometimes I find Kenyan coffees a bit of a pain to dial in as espresso - especially those such as this one primarily designed as a filter roast. However this one was really quite forgiving - I didn&#39;t have a single &quot;sink job&quot;. My usual &quot;rules&quot; for pulling light roast espresso holds true with this one and I ended up setlling on a longer ratio of 16.5g in to 45.0g out (around 1:2.75 ratio). The is not much to speak of in terms of mouthfeel but the sweetness really comes to the front and the acidity is well balanced. The same sort of tasting notes come through as in the filter. . Moving onto the jazz of the week. This time I have selected the Blue Note 1960 album &quot;Roll Call&quot; by Hank Mobley: . . Hank Mobley is one of my all time favourite jazz artists, some of his albums on Blue Note (both as leader and sideman) are simply incredible. I feel he has been a little hard done by however. He is not the &quot;household name&quot; (or whatever the equivalent is in jazz) - and many completely overlook him and focus on the Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter&#39;s of the world. Don&#39;t get me wrong those guys are fantastic and rightly deserve their acolades but we should show some love to Hank too! If you pick up a jazz record guide, and if they have Hank listed at all, they&#39;ll just compare him to those guys and not as an artist in his own right. Even the &quot;positive&quot; reviews label him as &quot;saxophone middleweight champion&quot; (refering to the fact he is not as flashy as a Rollins/Coltrane nor and sensual as a Stan Getz) - which I have always found a bit of a derogatory description since it reads a lot like a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; type description. . Hank&#39;s style is largely in the hard-bop realm. I find his playing to be incredibly mature, he can rip and has great chops but he chooses to hold back and focus on the groove much of the time. For him the music always came first before gaining recognition or noteriety. He didn&#39;t seem interested in &quot;innovating&quot; and creating a whole new paradigm, instead he was looking to create the most perfect hard-bop sound he could. This was evident in his tone which is sublime and for my money one of the best tenor sounds in all of jazz, it is big warm and inviting. Even when playing complicated fast lines his tone remains fat, that is something very few manage to achieve. . Mobley first made a name for himself for being part of Horace Silver&#39;s Jazz Messengers (which later became Art Blakey&#39;s Jazz Messengers) - given this was probably the pre-eminent hard-bop group of the era this gives some indication to his ability! After his stint with Silver he did some work with Donald Byrd and appeared alongside other such hard-bop talent such as Wynton Kelly, Philly Joe Jones and Grant Green. However as a sideman he was probably most well known for his incredibly productive partnership with trumpet legend Lee Morgan with whom he recorded some of the most well known and commercially successful hard-bop records. . On &quot;Roll Call&quot; the personel reads: . Hank Mobley - tenor saxophone | Freddie Hubbard - trumpet | Wynton Kelly - piano | Paul Chambers - bass | Art Blakey - drums | . Which is a pretty impressive line up, if you were playing &quot;fantasy hard-bop&quot; you would struggle to create a line up that would better this! It is no surprise then that from start to finish this album is a complete triumph. It kicks off with the title track (embedded at the start of this post) - a typical driving Art Blakey drum groove kicks off preceedings, followed by a latin influenced harmony from Hubbard and Mobley before breaking into the main theme. Within about 30s of the album starting we have already been taken on a musical rollercoaster and can tell this album will just ooze quality. One of my favourite cuts on the album is &quot;The More I See You&quot; which is a Warren and Gordon standard. This is the only standard on an album otherwise comprised of Mobley originals. To me this is the &quot;definitive&quot; version of this standard, from start to finish it is perfect. One of Mobley&#39;s great talents is his ability to work with the band - every member is serving the music and not themselves. The way he plays off Kelly&#39;s piano in the main theme is particularly good on this track. It is interesting to hear Hubbard play with a muted tone also, it is not something you hear too often and conjures up images of Miles. I find Hubbard an interesting artist, I feel as a sideman he is one of the best of all time however his releases as a band leader have never blown me away. . This album is so solid it is really difficult to pick out any &quot;top tracks&quot;, while as a work it is not &quot;innovative&quot; and its intent is more &quot;evolution&quot; than &quot;revolution&quot; - it is certainly worth your time. In jazz (and coffee, and as a matter of fact life in general) we often clamour to find something new and innovative and tend to under appreciate those that &quot;simply&quot; aim to perfect what is already there. Both &quot;Roll Call&quot; and &quot;Gaturiri AA&quot; fit into this camp - we can find more boundary pushing jazz and we can find more complicated processing methods and complex flavours. But in the end we can&#39;t take anything away from them. .",

            "title": "Tuesday Wonderland and PLOT Fidel Huancas",
            "content": "This week we are heading back to a relatively new roaster for me: PLOT coffee roasters in Woolwich. Readers may remember a trio of their coffees featured on the page a couple of months ago which were heavily favoured. This is part of my second order from them. I&#39;m hesitant to judge a roaster based on a single order so we will see if this one lives up to the previous coffees from them. . Again I am very impressed with the packaging, the pink and black branded packing boxes through to the &quot;sound wave&quot; style logos on the bags it is all very well done. The packaging is something I always look at when judging a roaster/coffee, it is my opinion that you make judgements about a coffee from the instant you see it and having attractive packaging adds to this. You &quot;first drink with your eyes&quot; is the expression I believe! Further good packaging to me suggests that a roaster is leaving no stone unturned, they are concerned with how their coffee is perceived at every step of the coffee drinking journey - I think this is a good indicator of attention to detail and passion, both of which are crucially important to find in a roaster. . The coffee today is called: &quot;Fidel Huancas - Chirinos Competition Lot&quot; - which is a bit of a mouthful. Fidel Huancas is the man behind the coffee, the producer who is responsible for ensuring the quality of the on site processing, growing, etc. Chirinos is the district of the province San Ignacio where the farm is located. This is in the north west corner of the country, not too far from the border with Ecuador. The term &quot;competition lot&quot; has sprung up more and more in recent years, it does not seem to be a protected term but is meant to be an indicator that the coffee is of a quality that it could be used in barita or brewing competitions. . A piece of information you often find on the label of a coffee or on the roasters website is &quot;altitude&quot; or &quot;elevation&quot; - this is measured in meters above sea level (MASL) and as one would expect represents how &quot;high&quot; the coffee bushes are grown. When I was first getting into specialty coffee many many moons ago people were obsessing over altitude, people often judging whether to buy a coffee based on this metric alone. These days it appears as though the metric is not given the weight it once was, which in my opinion is a good thing. Generally speaking a coffee at a higher altitude will be favoured as being sweeter and more complex, and so some aim for higher altitude coffees as a result. Unfortunately it is not quite that simple. Higher does not necessarily mean better, what really matters (or so it seems) is the speed at which the coffee plants grow which is related to temperature. At a higher altitude generally the temperature will be lower which means the plants will grow more slowly and develop the complex flavours and sugars we are after. However we can equally find lower altitude locations that have lower temperatures and slower growing cherries which are equally delicious! . Unfortunately temperature is not something that is easy to quantify, each day the temperature will fluctuate and over the course of a growing season there may be large swings. Even the &quot;average temperature&quot; nor the temperature range tell us very much at all. As such altitude has become the proxy metric used. Personally I never look at altitude at all when deciding on whether to buy or try a coffee, I have not found it a particularly useful indicator for any particular characteristic or quality. Everybody is different though, so if you find that there is a strong correlation between coffees you enjoy and the altitude they&#39;re grown at stick with it! . Moving onto the tasting of this coffee. The first thing that strikes me with this coffee is the dry aroma of the beans (both whole and ground) - the smell is very intense. I&#39;d describe it as a dried fruit sweet sort of smell laced with a delicate floral note. I usually find that the very best tasting coffees have a very intense dry aroma, it is not universally true and a great dry aroma does not always translate to a good cup but this coffee is onto a good start! As usual starting with my usual filter set up. The first thing I get hit with is apricot, this coffee has it in spades! Those that know me know that, while I&#39;m not big on desserts, an apricot tart is one of my favourite things. This coffee reminds me a bit of that. If apricot is the head note of the coffee the heart is sweet caramel which gives some body to the coffee, perhaps apricot compote is a good descriptor given this syrupy body. As the coffee cools floral notes begin to appear and these linger in the aftertaste which is long lived and clean. Moving onto the espresso the flavour profile is much the same. I found that this coffee likes to be pulled long, about a 2.7:1 works for me. Too short and the flavours get a bit muddled and it&#39;s hard to discern individual notes. As a longer pull the flavours are defined and totally delicious! At this level the syrupy mouthfeel has all but gone but I feel this is a fair compromise. Pulling out floral notes in an espresso can be difficult, they are often dominated by the &quot;heavier&quot; notes but they manage to punch through in the aftertaste here. . This is another stand out coffee for me from the folks at PLOT. If this one is not in my shortlist for &quot;coffees of the year&quot; I have some outstanding coffees to look forward to in the last 6 months of the year! . This week&#39;s jazz is the 2006 seminal album &quot;Tuesday Wonderland&quot; by EsbjÃ¶rn Svennson Trio (EST) on the ACT record label: . . I remember the lead up to this album being released very vividly, at the time I was a regular reader of Jazzwise magazine and it felt like every issue for the year leading up to the release (and subsequently) had an article about this album. By this point EST were already big names in the jazz world. In the late 1990s to early 2000s jazz was in a bit of a lull, by this point the whole &quot;fusion&quot; thing had lost its way and there was a movement back towards more &quot;traditional&quot; styles, however what was lacking was a young act who won international acclaim, this is where EST came in. They almost singlehandedly kept jazz alive during this period and spawned many imitators who are still playing with the &quot;EST sound&quot; today. Unusually for an album surrounded in such hype and expectation &quot;Tuesday Wonderland&quot; not only lived up to it but possibly exceeded it, which is not something you can say often. . The EST style is hard to put down in words but unmistakable once you hear it. There is a clear influence of modern European classical composers (they list Bartok in particular as an influence regularly). EsbjÃ¶rn&#39;s piano style also takes inspiration from Keith Jarrett to my ear. While each member plays (primarily) on acoustic instruments they layer these with multi-track recording and run electronic effects to keep things fresh. Magnus ÃstrÃ¶m is on drum duty for the band and plays with both manic urgency as well as tender subtlty, feeling most at home playing drum and bass and techno grooves. Dan Berglund on bass brings with him the thunderous weight through the rock and heavy metal influence to preceedings. EST represents &quot;fusion&quot; in its truest sense being a melting pot of ideas. In doing this they managed to create a sound all to themselves that is not like anything that came before it. . One of my favourite pieces from the entire EST back catalogue is &quot;The Goldhearted Miner&quot; (embedded above). It is a beautiful subtle piece with a very strong melody. It is the sort of tune I could imagine being a standard if it had been released some 60 years earlier. It does not have quite the &quot;broad influence&quot; that some of the other pieces on the album have however. Perhaps their biggest hit is &quot;Goldwrap&quot;: This even had a &quot;proper&quot; music video associated with it! Back in 2006 this was essentially unheard of, I can&#39;t think of another record from the era that had that sort of reach. It shows how big the band had become, I seem to remember even seeing this appear on the music TV channels on satelite television at the time. Compared to &quot;The Goldhearted Miner&quot; this one features more prominently some of the electronic effects on the instruments and some of the EST-isms that made the band so popular. . Live the band were also a force to be reckoned with. They managed to attract a young &quot;hip&quot; crowd that comprised of jazz fans, electronic music fans and rock fans alike. The crowd hanging on every single the note, and the band acting like a conductor whipping the audience up into a frenzy. There was also a running &quot;bit&quot; that EsbjÃ¶rn did; the band would play 3 or 4 tunes on the bounce and then EsbjÃ¶rn would try to announce what was just played to the crowd but &quot;forgot&quot; the names and the more eager members of the audience would shout out to remind him. I&#39;m not sure if it was a genuine slip of the mind from being so deep into the moment or whether it was just a shtick, either way it certainly added a little humour to the gigs. . Unfortunately EsbjÃ¶rn died tragically young, at just the age of 44, in a freak scuba diving accident in 2008 only 2 years after the release of &quot;Tuesday Wonderland&quot;. This was a devestating event in recent jazz history and he will be sorely missed. I was forunate enough to catch, what turned out to be, one of the last UK shows. It was truly fantastic and a totally memorable experience. Afterwards I even got to meet the band as they hung around for autographs and the like. Unfortunately camera phones of the day were still fairly rudimentary (at least the one I had) so I do not have a high-def picture but you can see me as a fresh-faced wee nipper below: . . To end this post I&#39;ll leave one of the more experimental cuts from the album called: &quot;Brewery of Beggars&quot;. I feel this really captures the &quot;melting pot&quot; ethos of the band and highlights the use of electronic effects and rockier sounds the band were known for. .",

            "title": "The Grand Wazoo and Assembly Bumbogo",
            "content": "This week we are sticking with the London based Assembly coffee roasters. We are drinking a washed Rwandan coffee by the name Bumbogo. Those who have read previous blog posts here will know about the Assembly &quot;paint swirls&quot; for this coffee the swirl can be seen below: . . As with many Rwandans this coffee is a bourbon varietal, which we have talked about in the blog in the past. Rwanda is a fairly small country that shares many land borders. This particular coffee is grown in the Gakenke region which is in the north of the country and is close to the borders with Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For such a small country Rwanda produces lots of great coffees with a reasonable amount of variation. I would say the &quot;classic&quot; Rwandan style of coffee has high acidity and sweetness typically with lots of red berry type tasting notes. . Washed African coffees roasted for filter (such as this one) can be notoriously finnicky to dial in for espresso, many do not even bother trying and stick to more developed darker roasts which are more forgiving and do not have quite as much acidity. Personally this is my favourite style of espresso and so I will talk about some things that I do to make these roasts work for me. . Starting off with the water: even as espresso a large amount of what you&#39;re drinking is water. A water that tastes good on its own does not necessarily translate to good coffee (but a bad tasting water certainly will translate to bad coffee!) A lot has been written about water for coffee and the widely held consensus is there are 2 components of the water that matter: the &quot;general hardness&quot; ions (calcium and magnesium) and &quot;buffer&quot; (carbonates and bicarbonates). Without getting too deep into the science at a very high level the &quot;general hardness&quot; carries the flavour and the &quot;buffer&quot; acts to reduce the acidity. One might think then that a large amount of calcium/magnesium in the water is a good thing as it will enhance the flavour, but this is generally not the case - too little and the coffee is hollow tasting, too much and it tastes muddy and lacking clarity. There is a sweet spot. The same with bicarbonate, too little and the acidity can be harsh and too much and the coffee tastes dull. . With a bright acidic style of coffee one might assume that we would want a higher buffer content to try and &quot;tame&quot; the acidity. In my experience this is not true, I find for the lighter roasts you want a &quot;lighter&quot; water with fewer ions. This seems to let the coffee speak a bit more. I find the lightly mineralized water out of my RO unit works well, this has a remineralization cartridge which adds in some of these ions (but nothing else). For those not looking to go that far bottled water typically has a composition on the label which you can use. You can treat the water with a filter jug (for example) but the quality is directly tied to the quality of your tap water. . Another important consideration is the grinder you use. The general consensus is you want to have a flat burr grinder as opposed to a conical burr grinder for lighter roasts since they can produce a more uniform grind distribution. A rule of thumb is the bigger the burrs the better the grinder, but there are exceptions and things like alignment matter as does burr speed. That&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t get good quality light roast espresso with a conical just typically the flat burr grinders are preffered. . Moving onto the dialing in process itself, in my experience there are 2 variables that really make the difference with light roasts: brew temperature and ratio. Generally you will want a hotter brew for a lighter roast in my experience, the acidity &quot;turns into&quot; sweetness with a high temperature (I&#39;m aware that&#39;s not correct at a chemical level). But you have to be careful, turning up too high and you lose everything, all the flavours are lost and you&#39;re left with a cup of &quot;brown&quot;. Very small changes make a big difference, if your machine doesn&#39;t have temperature control then you can often &quot;temperature surf&quot; by pulling blank shots to vary the temperature but you don&#39;t have quite the same control obviously. . The ratio of an espresso is the weight of liquid you are left with versus how much dry ground coffee you put into the portafilter. A typical ratio for a &quot;normal&quot; espresso is 2:1 - say you put 18g coffee in the basket then you&#39;d pull a shot that gives 36g of liquid. For lighter roasts longer is generally better, sometimes even up to &quot;lungo&quot; range of 3:1 or even more. Pulling the shot longer again accentuates the sweetness. However in doing so you lose body and if you go too far you&#39;ll end up with a weaker &quot;watery&quot; type shot that is not enjoyable. As a starting point 2.5:1 is generally my go to and I adjust from there. . If you read a guide online to dialing in espresso there will be a lot of talk about &quot;timing&quot; and how the &quot;perfect&quot; shot will take 27-32s to pull. While this might be a decent yardstick for a more normal roast for light roasts this will lead to disappointment in my experience. Lighter roasts like to be pulled in a different way, typically a longer slower pre-infusion stage (this lightly saturates the puck with water to &quot;prime&quot; it and raise the temperature of the coffee puck) followed by a much quicker pull - possibly in the region of 20s. I don&#39;t use timing as a variable I &quot;target&quot; I let the timing fall as it falls but I keep a note of it for consistency reasons, if I&#39;m pulling a shot again and it&#39;s much slower/quicker it might suggest I&#39;ve done something else incorrectly in my prep! . There are a few other smaller considerations that seem to help in my experience: firstly tamping, a light tamp is your friend (up to a point!) tamping hard is unnecessary and seems to lead to more channeling and other issues. I also like to dose less with light roast coffees whereas I might normally dose 18g for a more developed roast I might go down as low as 15g for a particuarly light roast as that seems to work a bit better. In addition to this I find that underdosing a basket (e.g. putting those 15g of coffee into an 18g basket) helps with ensuring the pre-infusion is slower and more gentle - although this might just be an artefact of the setups I have used rather than a universal truth. . But back onto Bumbogo itself: starting as always with the filter. We have the typical &quot;red berry&quot; Rwandan type thing coming to the front. Assembly describe this as a &quot;cranberry&quot; note which I don&#39;t disagree with at all - it has that slightly tart/sour note in there. This is supported with a caramel or burnt sugar sort of note which helps balance the acidity. I like to taste the coffees before reading the tasting notes and one thing I wrote down is a green grape like finish which Assembly did not note. Overall it is quite a clean tasting coffee but with a thick syrupy sort of body. It is not the most complex coffee I&#39;ve ever had but it is certainly delicious. Onto the espresso I was a little amazed at just how forgiving this was, I struggled to make a &quot;bad&quot; shot. I found that it worked best at very high temperatures and around a 2.2:1 ratio. There the cranberry and red currant notes really come to the front and the body is syrupy and has hints of a heavy red wine like quality. Overall a very good little coffee! . This weeks album is likely to be a little contenious: Frank Zappa - The Grand Wazoo: . . Some may argue &quot;but this is not jazz!&quot; - but I&#39;ve never been particularly concerned with defined boundaries to musical genres, some of my favourite albums straddle the line between multiple styles. This might mean the jazz police will knock down the doors of JazzCoffeeStuff HQ but that&#39;s a price worth paying. . Over the years Frank made some rather disparaging comments about jazz which didn&#39;t do much to endear him to the jazz community. However looking at the personnel in some of his bands I think it&#39;s safe to say we should take some of the comments at face value, many great jazz musicians played with him over the years. He also famously had Mahavishnu Orchestra open for him on a few tours, the experience left such an imprint that Frank completely tore down his band a built a new band and sound up in its place.In addition he wrote a piece dedicated to Eric Dolphy (although not on this album) - if Eric didn&#39;t die so tragically young we can only imagine what would have happened had he recorded with Frank. I find the &quot;Dolphy influence&quot; quite strong through a lot of Franks work, I can only assume it is through the love both of them share for composer Edgar Varese. . Frank composed, recorded and released this album in 1972 while he was in rehab following his assault by a fan in London a year earlier. It follows on in the vain of Waka/Jawacka which itself follows on from Hot Rats in terms of Frank&#39;s jazz-fusion offerings. . The Grand Wazoo is a bit of an outlier in the Zappa back catalogue. It features a large band (22 members) and some brilliant arrangements. It is possibly the &quot;jazziest&quot; of Frank&#39;s jazz fusion offerings. I have to admit I sometimes struggle with fusion when it attempts to employ a &quot;rock&quot; feel. A big part of rock is the attitude and often on fusion records a jazz guy will add some distorted guitars and think that is enough and the whole thing ends up sounding nerdy rather than cool. Given Frank is at home in a rock context the blend is much more seemless than many. The album is almost entirely instrumental apart from a few vocal lines on &quot;For Calvin (And His Next Two Hitch-Hikers)&quot; (which tells a narrative of 2 warring musical factions according to the liner notes). . The modern classical influence is also noticable on this album. Given when it was released this was probably one of the first examples on record of Frank playing with these ideas, the time spent alone following the assault probably gave him a chance to better explore these ideas. . For me the two standout pieces are the two closing tracks. &quot;Eat That Question&quot; (embedded above) is an absolutely raucous affair starting off with a short intro from jazz-keyboard maestro and long-term Zappa collaborator George Duke. Before breaking into the main theme which is one of the strongest melodies in the Zappa canon and one he came back to many times when performing live. . The final track on the album is called &quot;Blessed Relief&quot;: This is a much more mellow and chilled out affair. However the melody isn&#39;t any less strong and features some absolutely beautiful arrangement. Some Zappa tunes can get a bit &quot;complicated for the sake of complicated&quot; which sometimes has its place, however on this one we see Frank is just as able to write a &quot;straight&quot; tune. . As a guitar player Frank was always what I consider a &quot;visceral&quot; player, he doesn&#39;t aim to have perfect technique he just plays what he feels. Most of the time he solos over one chord vamps, sometimes for 10-20mins at time. Many guitarists look down on him for this but being able to play for an extended time over a one chord vamp is a real skill, you very quickly end up aimlessly noodling without any changes to drive your ideas forward. It is always noticable on Zappa records where the supporting musicians solo over the changes of the compositions but when it comes time for Frank&#39;s turn they revert to a simple vamp. On &quot;Blessed Relief&quot; however we are treated to hearing Frank play the changes, which is certainly note worthy in itself! He doesn&#39;t approach this in the way a jazz player might and he&#39;s only following the changes in a fairly loose sense but it is great to hear. . Perhaps the most &quot;jazzy&quot; of all the pieces on show however is the title track &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; (depending on the pressing you own of the record this may be the first or the second track!) Clocking in at over 13 minutes it is by far the longest and most ambitious piece on the record. While the tempo is quite frantic the music itself slowly glides through the various themes and motifs present throughout the piece. In some sense it has the &quot;swan like&quot; quality of many of the successful jazz big-bands - elegantly gliding along but under the surface paddling manically! There are some brilliantly wild brass and woodwind solos dotted throughout the piece but it is really the arrangement itself that is so memorable. You could easily dedicate a blog post (or more) analysing every technique and trick on show here but ultimately the proof is in the listening: Overall I consider this album one of the strongest in the Zappa catalogue and one certainly worthy of your time. .",

            "title": "Expectations and Assembly Raimutin",
            "content": "In this blog post we&#39;re heading back to Assembly coffee roasters located in Brixton, London. For my money Assembly are consistently one of the best roasters in the country and one of my favourites since they seem to share very similar taste preferences to me - no matter what I buy from them I&#39;m always left impressed. . The coffee this week is called Raimutin, it is naturally processed and is made up of a lend of Timor, moka and typica varietals. In a previous blog post we learned that &quot;most coffee varietals can trace their lineage back to either typica or bourbon&quot; - in this case that is not true. To understand the Timor varietal we need to take a step further back in coffees history. Coffee plants can be split into two broad camps: Arabica and Robusta (there are a few others but they&#39;re rare and for arguments sake this is a good description). The &quot;typica-bourbon&quot; lineage exists in the arabica side. Arabica is typically favoured for higher cup quality and depth of flavour - specialty coffee is almost entirely dominated by Arabica. The &quot;downsides&quot; of arabica are lower yields and lower caffeine content. The Timor varietal is essentially a hybrid between arabica and robusta. It retains a lot of the robusta hardiness and is more resistant to leaf-rust, pests, etc. while retaining some of the arabica cup quality. . Raimutin is from the country of Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. You would be forgiven for not having heard of this country before since it only found its sovereignty in 2002. It shares a small island with Indonesian-Timor to its south-west. It is located in south-east Asia - between Indonesia and Australia. For those who enjoy a pub quiz it is also the only Asian country to be entirely located in the southern hemisphere. In recent years coffee production in Timor-Leste has increased and every now and again their coffees pop up in quality roasteries. . I have to admit I am not usually a fan of Asian coffees, I tend to find them a bit heavy for my taste and they often seem to have &quot;smokey&quot; or &quot;tobacco&quot; style notes I personally do not care for (although I understand why people love them). I have heard through the grapevine that the &quot;best&quot; Asian coffees do not leave the area and you have to travel to the area to really try the best the area has to offer. Having never travelled there let alone tasted coffee there I don&#39;t know if there is any truth to this. Since this coffee was roasted by Assembly I thought I&#39;d try it however as I&#39;ve yet to have a coffee from them I disliked (in fact this is my second bag of this coffee - I ordered a &quot;mystery bundle&quot; of a random selection of coffees and this one was included.) . I can&#39;t mention the Assembly roastery without mentioning the packaging, the most stylish beautifully designed packaging I have ever seen! Plus they&#39;re not foil backed bags so they&#39;re easy to recycle which is a positive. I know many will say packaging doesn&#39;t make a difference, but I disagree entirely. From the moment you pick up a bag of coffee you make subconcious assessments about it. These definitely carry over to the cup. Unfortunately with current world events it appears they are struggling to source their usual bags so the coffee arrived in &quot;interim packaging&quot; (their phrasing) which is still quite nice (but not quite as elegant as the usual offering). What I really like about the Assembly aesthetic is their &quot;paint swirl&quot; logo designs. For this particular coffee this is: . . I don&#39;t know if I have a very mild form of synesthesia or what but I definitely taste &quot;in colour&quot; - by which I mean the first thing that pops into my head when tasting anything is &quot;this tastes green&quot; or &quot;this tastes yellow&quot;, it then takes me a while to translate this &quot;green&quot; into a grape or the &quot;yellow&quot; into a banana flavour note. I tend to find the paint swirls for individual coffees to be a good match to the flavour notes of the coffee inside. . Starting off in the usual way with a pour-over filter brew: the first thing that hits me in the face is &quot;purple&quot; - in this case for me this is shows as plum and cherry brandy. I tend to find some natural processed coffees to have this &quot;boozy&quot; fortified alcohol sort of quality to them and this one certainly has that. However it is not a super-funky natural, there is some funk there but it is more a Bruno Mars pop record influenced by funk rather than a full blown George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic. The mouthfeel of the coffee is big and juicy yet it still remains fairly &quot;clean&quot; tasting for a coffee of this style. There is some acidity cutting through the sweetness and body however, for me it takes the form of a lime sharpness and it really helps balance everything out. I find this one needs to cool down a bit before it really comes alive. . Moving onto the espresso (in the last blog post we didn&#39;t touch on espresso so it&#39;s nice to bring it back) - for me this is where it really shines. The big body really comes to the forefront and you are left with a really pleasing thick shot even when you pull it slightly longer (which is recommended). The boozy notes are still there in force and it is really rich and indulgent. The acidity is still there but it&#39;s just there for ballast to support the bigger bolder notes. For a fairly light roast coffee I find this one of the easiest to pull espressos out there, it is super forgiving and you can really swing the grind settings around and still get super tasty shots out of it. My &quot;recipe&quot; for this one was 16.5g of coffee in to 38.0g of coffee out. I set the temperature of my machine to almost as high as it goes. I pre-infuse for around 5-10s and then my shot time comes in at around 22-24s. For me this is the sweetspot - you still get the lovely indulgent mouthfeel but it&#39;s long enough that the flavours don&#39;t get too lost. . Overall a super fun enjoyable coffee! In both filter and espresso there is a (very) long aftertaste which is satisfying, it pretty much mimics the flavours in the cup itself and is clean and pleasant, no hint of any sourness or acrid qualities that sometimes come with these long aftertastes. . To pair with this coffee I have settled on an album from 1972 from Keith Jarrett called &quot;Expectations&quot; . . The album was released on the Columbia record label, Jarrett having recorded with Miles Davis on this label previously. It is Jarrett&#39;s only record on Columbia under his own name. He then moved onto the ECM label and played a large part in the success of that label. . At JazzCoffeeStuff I try and not be negative but I am going to break that rule today. Not through the music on this album or Jarrett&#39;s music in general which is fantastic, but about the man himself. Jarrett has always tried to paint himself as a &quot;saviour&quot; or &quot;holier than thou&quot; sort of figure which I&#39;ve personally never taken to. As a result he essentially bans any extraneous noise in his concerts, as a result they have an atmosphere more akin to a morgue than to a place of enjoyment. For me the community aspect and audience &quot;participation&quot; of a jazz concert is part of the magic, cutting that out kills the music. I know he&#39;s trying to elevate the music to that of &quot;high art&quot;, and I get that, but for me it loses all that is important about the art form. I remember a few years ago he was playing at the London Jazz Festival (I didn&#39;t go to that particular concert) and through a friend I understand he heard a &quot;whirring&quot; in the audience so stormed off stage - it turned out to be a person in a wheelchair. Eventually he was persuaded to come back on stage but offered nothing in the way of an apology. I have heard plenty of other &quot;horror stories&quot; about his concerts, it&#39;s a real shame. . My second complaint with Jarrett is the &quot;Jarrett grunts&quot; - when improvising he will very loudly grunt and it is completely atonal and has nothing to do with what he&#39;s playing. He doesn&#39;t need to do it because I&#39;ve heard him play many times without doing so, I&#39;m not really sure why he does this. You can here some of this in the clip below (but take nothing away from the sheer quality of the piano playing) With those rants out of the way lets get onto the album itself. Thankfully in 1972 Jarrett hadn&#39;t yet gone &quot;full grunt&quot; and so there isn&#39;t a whole lot of this to distract on the album. After a short introduction piece the album kicks off proper with &quot;Common Mama&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog post) - and what a start it is. Keith is joined by Paul Motian on drums, Charlie Haden on the Bass, Sam Brown on guitar, Dewey Redman on tenor sax and Airto Moreira on percussion. In addition there are uncredited string and brass sections. The main melody of Common Mama is so strong you can be humming it for weeks after hearing it. By having both drums and percussion the rhythm section is really grooving and it allows Dewey a chance to really let loose and get wild! The combination of Motian/Haden/Redman is something you&#39;re more likely to hear on a purely &quot;free&quot; album, it is interesting to hear them in the context of &quot;prettier&quot; music. . The free side doesn&#39;t stay hidden for long however and by track 4 &quot;Roussillion&quot; we&#39;re treated to a piece that wouldn&#39;t be out of place on an Ornette Coleman album. In fact the main melody itself does have a tinge of &quot;Lonely Woman&quot; about it. Motian is absolutely in his element here driving the complex melody throughout and directing the soloists with ease. Motian is one of my favourite drummers in that respect and is probably deserving of more kudos than he gets. Being a double album there is a lot of music on show, and it is an extremely eclectic mix. Ranging from the more latin world-music influences of the opening number, through more typical &quot;Jarrett&quot; classically inspired pieces through to the rampant free-jazz. Along the way there&#39;s also glimmers of soul-jazz and jazz-rock fusion and at points even &quot;calypso&quot;. As a result this is quite a hard record to &quot;classify&quot;, it is almost a microcosm all to itself. That is probably why this is an often overlooked album in the Jarrett back-catalogue. However it shows what a tremendous talent Jarrett has as a band leader, composer and improviser. For my money it should be celebrated as a masterpiece and one record that is surely worth your time. We&#39;ll end with the beautiful title track which is definitely the &quot;most Jarrett&quot; piece on the album: .",

            "title": "Clifford Brown & Max Roach and Gold Box Cupping",
            "content": "For my tenth post on this blog we&#39;re going to do something a bit different this week. Instead of focussing on one particular coffee we are going to look at many! I purchased a &quot;taster&quot; pack from the folks at Gold Box Coffee Roasters and decided to do some cupping! Unfortunately the tasting packs are small (around 30g each) and so I will not be able to talk about espresso this week (but that will surely change in the next installment). . I bought one sample in particular that I did not want to form part of the cupping as I wanted to investigate it fully. It is a Bolivian Gesha varietal with a semi-anaerobic processing. This is one of the &quot;fancy new&quot; processing methods that has sprung up in recent years, in essence we can think of most of these as being variations on a natural processing but with more measurement/controlled conditions. In this case the coffee spends part of its processing life in sealed air-tight containers where the fermentations can be controlled. I tend to find these experimental processing methods a bit hit and miss, sometimes they produce wild and interesting flavour notes but sometimes they will impart a &quot;hollow&quot; vibe somewhat akin to a decaf process in my opinion. . Bolivia is one of my favourite origins, when I was first getting into specialty (c2008) there were a lot of Bolivians on the market and they form some of my favourite early coffee memories (I remember a particuarly good one from Monmouth and a few from Hasbean). However over the years the specialty coffee production has decreased in the country owing to the country allowing the growth of Coca (used to make cocaine) which offers more dependable money to farmers, sadly as a result many coffee plants have been torn out and possibly lost forever. There are still some high quality coffees coming out of the region however. . The Gesha varietal has become a bit of a poster-child for the specialty industry lately, in any barista/roasting competition it has basically become a showcase for Gesha varietals. The varietal is believed to have originated in Ethiopia but it rose to prominence thanks to a particular farm in Panama which bumped the price of the varietal into the stratosphere. The varietal itself produces very floral and fragrant coffee. The flavour profiles tend to be delicate or muted but they are notoriously &quot;marmite&quot; with some people not liking them at all. I&#39;ve had my fair share of Gesha and while it&#39;s great I don&#39;t like to spend the big bucks on them as I tend to find the value proposition is better elsewhere. This particular coffee from Gold Box, however, piqued my interest because I have never had a Bolivian Gesha so wanted to give it a go. . I&#39;m really glad I gave it a try! But I&#39;m a little annoyed at myself for not buying a full bag (I had 50g only - about 3 cups worth). It is a truly special coffee, it has that delicate floral nature and all the fragrance you would want. There is a strong ginger note to it too which I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve noticed in another coffee before. With the floral nature it is a little like having a good quality black tea and a ginger nut - but all in one cup! It&#39;s complex enough to keep you interested and coming back for more yet not so challenging as to be a distraction from whatever else you are doing. I would describe both the sweetness and acidity as medium, it is very down the middle (in a good way). There is some body there but not too much, you still get a lot of clarity in the cup. There is no hint of the &quot;emptiness&quot; of a fancy processing method, I&#39;m not sure whether if this is because it has only spent part of its life anaerobically or whether it is just done particuarly well. Overall I&#39;m very impressed with it, I would certainly buy again and I&#39;d love to see how it performs as an espresso (Geshas tend to be a bit difficult to dial in). Hopefully this is a sign of things to come with the cupping! . I&#39;ll quickly outline my cupping methodology, I don&#39;t follow a specific guideline and I like to do things a little differently to some. I am not a professional cupper nor do I do it very often. Coffee should be fun however so with any method you should tailor it to suit you! In total I have 8 coffee samples from various origins. As soon as the coffee arived I removed the labels and replaced them with a randomly generated 3 alpha-numeric identifier (storing the key on my computer to look up after!) I like to use codes like this when blind tasting as opposed to &quot;coffee 1&quot; or &quot;coffee A&quot; as that naturally sets up an expectation that &quot;1&quot; is better than &quot;2&quot; and so on. I then left the coffees for a week so that there would be very little chance I&#39;d remember the codes I set up (it&#39;s safe to say it worked, I can&#39;t even remember what origins there were let alone specific coffees!) So this is about as blind as I can make a test on my own. . . For the cupping itself I used 7.5g of coffee to 125g of 100 degree water. I lined the bowls with filter paper so I could scoop out the grinds in one go (I hate the gritty feeling of grinds in the bowl so I removed them - I know this is not traditional). I grind fairly coarse at around a french press level and I leave them to brew for 3 minutes before removing the grinds. I do not like doing large cuppings with many different coffees as I find it hard to keep track so I broke the 8 coffees into 2 groups of 4. On the first day I cupped 4 and selected the best 2, the second day I took the other 4 and selected the best 2 and on the final day I took the &quot;winners&quot; and played them off against each other to find which one I enjoyed most. . There are many different types of scoring one can use, I prefer a simple scoring system. I have 5 categories: Aroma (broken down into dry and wet), Acidity, Sweetness, Body and Aftertaste. Each gets a score out of 10, I sum them up and double it to get a score out of 100. I then allow myself an &quot;adjustment&quot; to that score should I feel it needs it, for example a coffee may not have a lot of body but overall I like the taste more than another so want to correct for that. This is only in exceptional circumstances however, typically the score will not be adjusted. My scoring does not match the SCA system in any way. Since I only cup coffees that are specialty grade that have already passed numerous tastings it&#39;s unlikely I&#39;ll find anything under an 80 on the SCA scale - my scoring gives we scope to go below this if needed. . . I will just briefly summarise my findings: . Day 1 . YEY - Tis coffee presented with a fruity round smell. The acidity was delicate with a dried cranberry sort of vibe. The sweetness was very high and there wasn&#39;t too much body. The aftertaste was clean and fairly shortlived. 73/100 | INQ - A big punch in the face of a coffee. Strong caramels and nuts combined with dried and fragrant stone fruits on the nose. Fairly high in acidty and syrupy sweet. Not much mouthfeel but a big body. Aftertaste was neutral. 80/100 | TYH - Not much of anything at all, it&#39;s as if the coffee is a bit stale. These came vac-packed without roast dates so it might be an old sample. 56/100 | TUU - A medium sweet medium acidity coffee with a lower body. In the aftertaste I picked up a note I wasn&#39;t 100% happy with so given the strength of competition it got marked down harshly. 60/100 | . Day 2 . OWR - Cherry and red-fruit aromas with caramels and honey. The acidity was nice and balanced and easy to drink. The sweetness reminded me of rosehips with a hint of florals. Overall very good. 73/100 | M2X - Just not my sort of coffee, heavy, dense, thick. Very nutty and chocolate-y with a malty-biscuity sort of vibe. Nothing wrong with it, just not for me. 60/100 | CXH - Similar to OWR - it was difficult to seperate these two. Very sugary sweet with honey-like qualities. Overall OWR pipped it to the post thanks to the subtle floral note. 72/100 | K2E - Now this was a complicated coffee. Totally different to the others so hard to compare them fairly. So many florals! Also a peachy-blueberry sort of fruitiness. This one came alive when it cooled down. It is not particularly sweet or acidity so the score suffers a bit. 74/100 | . The Playoffs . Now moving onto finding the best of the best. The finalists are: INQ, K2E, YEY and OWR - ranked by their first round scores. As I&#39;m not a professional cupper nor do this often enough I do not put much weight on my scores day to day - it&#39;s highly swayed by my mood or whatever else I have eaten/done that day! My findings on the final cupping day were: . OWR - The honey caramel notes on the nose are more prominent. I&#39;m picking up an orange note this time more than a red-fruit vibe. Again the acidity was balanced and not overpowering at all. In terms of sweetness this was the sweetest on show for me, the honey caramels really shining through. Probably the thinnest body of all of them however. The aftertaste is punchy with orange and caramel but it dissipates very quickly and doesnt linger. Overall very easy to drink but a touch one-dimensional. 72/100 | INQ - Much as before this one is a power-house absolutely out-muscling the other coffees on show. If you&#39;re after a flavour-bomb this one is probably it! There are chocolates and caramels there but also a lot of dried and stone fruits and through it all still a floral note underlying it all. It has the biggest body of all on show. Despite its power the aftertaste is not too overbearing and does not linger too long. 79/100 | K2E - Again the most complex coffee here by quite a long way. Super interesting and at a certain temperature it just comes alive. Florals are the name of the day, it is like filling your mouth with lavendar and rose petals. This is combined with a peach-y sweetness and a creamy mouthfeel. The aftertaste is highly perfumed and lingers a long time. 81/100 | YEY - Red-fruits are prominent on the nose throughout combined with a caramel note. The acidity is crisp and reminds me of a green apple or a lime. The red-fruits come out in the sweetness in the form of cherry candy! As it cools a floral note presents itself. It is neither as sweet as OWR nor as floral complex as K2E. The aftertaste is sweet and long lasting. 76/100 | . So there we have it the winner is: K2E. Noting that this is just my pallette. There are a couple of other things I noticed before I look at what the coffees actually were: . OWR and CXH are remarkably similar | I would be very surprised if K2E is anything other than an Ethiopian (I would guess a Guji natural if pushed) | I don&#39;t have a clue what INQ is - it has many different qualities. Whatever it is it is done well! | OWR has to be a honey processed coffee from the Americas - I&#39;m thinking Costa Rica | I think M2X has to either be a Brazilian or a particularly heavy Colombian | The Reveal . The coffees were: . K2E - Hambela Halaka (Ethiopia Natural) | INQ - Bolivia Caranavi (Bolivia Washed) | YEY - Rwanda Ruvumbu 035 (Rwanda Washed) | OWR - Costa Rica Juanachute Canet (Costa Rica Honey) | CXH - Costa Rica Los Urena (Costa Rica Honey) | TUU - Los Pirineos Pacamara (El Salvador Natural) | M2X - Brazil Santo Andre Mondo Novo (Brazil Natural) | TYH - Ethiopia Rocko Mountain (Ethiopia Natural) | Thankfully most of my predictions turned out to be reasonable! I don&#39;t have to hand in my membership card to the coffee bloggers union. It is interesting that the Ethiopian Rocko Mountain was last - this is a coffee I have had many times before from various roasters and always enjoy. It just had no oomph in this test, it could be the preperation method, user error or slightly stale beans. But I do usually find Rocko is better suited to espresso. It is also interesting that I couldn&#39;t place the Bolivian coffee as stated above the production yields have fallen drastically in recent years and so I&#39;ve not been able to drink as much as I would like so am less familiar than I used to be. . It is also interesting that the ordering of the coffees ended up pretty much matched my expectations - that is if you just listed these coffees and made me put them in preference order it would very closely match this list (minus the Rocko anomoly). . The Jazz . With all the coffee stuff taken care of let&#39;s move onto this weeks jazz. Usually I try and link the jazz to the particular coffee or theme I want to write about. This week I can&#39;t really do that so it is a completely free choice, which is tough. I ultimately decided on an absolute classic released in 1954: &quot;Clifford Brown &amp; Max Roach&quot; - with which we can hardly go wrong. . . Released on the Verve record label this was a highly anticipated record. Clifford Brown and Max Roach being titans of their field, there was hope that this would pave a new path for bebop in the 50s following on from the earlier Bird and Diz work of the 40s. The record did not disappoint and instantly got recognised as one of the most important jazz records to date. The line up on the record is: . Clifford Brown â trumpet | Harold Land â tenor saxophone | George Morrow â bass | Richie Powell â piano | Max Roach â drums | . Of course Brown and Roach are the &quot;stars&quot; here but what really stands out to me is the call and response interplay between Brown and Land. It is one of the greatest examples of this interplay ever put onto a record. They work together seemlessly creating highly intricate shared ideas that never feels like &quot;8 bars for you, then 8 for me&quot;. This is displayed clearly on the 2nd track &quot;Parisian Throughfare&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). . Of course the power and restless energy of Roach keeps the whole thing moving along. This is not easy to do, it is all to easy to lose sight of the swing and just start throwing chops at a tune. Max, and the other top tier drummers, actually listen to the music and only let loose when the music calls for it. . The understated work of Morrow should also not be understated, with everything going on in the music there is always a need to keep things grounded. The musician filling that role rarely gets the recognition they deserve so this is a shout out to George Morrow in that regard. . Another interesting part of this album is the juxtaposition of the harder bebop-focussed tunes paired with simple sweet lyrical ballads. It makes for an album that keeps you on your toes from start to finish. A great example of this is a beautiful take on the standard &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; Here Richie Powell (who did not quite reach the level of stardom of his brother Bud) absolutely shines through with understated lyricism and beauty, he and George Morrow fitting together perfectly. Max Roach leaving his ego at the door picks up the brushes and plays, perhaps, his simplest drum lines to date but it is just what the tune called for. Clifford Brown actually sits out the entire tune - on a tune that appears under your own name this requires a great deal of self control and keeping your ego in check! . Any talk of Clifford Brown is not complete without talking about his tone. His sound is completely recognisable, it is big round and warm. Unlike others at the time who were typically searching for a colder harsher sound. This inspired a generation of players including Lee Morgan, Donald Byrd and Freddie Hubbard through to later artists such as Roy Hargrove. To make the most of this sound he played longer flowing lines as opposed to the shorter stocatto trumpet lines that came before him. It is a shame he died so young (in a car crash) - we only have 4 years worth of his recording. Despite this he was and still is a huge inspiration, he achieved in 4 years what many musicians fail to achieve in a lifetime. . In jazz there are a few albums that are so great they are essentially &quot;no-brainers&quot; for me this is certainly one of them. .",

            "title": "Injuries and Long and Short Prince",
            "content": "In this blog we are looking at the last of my (current) order from the Long and Short roastery ( https://longandshort.london/ ) of the last few blog posts. . This time we are travelling to Burundi and the Tangara region. Burundi is a small east African country sharing borders with Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the west/south and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west. Given its shape it is sometimes called the heart of Africa. In recent years I have find Burundi to be one of the main challengers for &quot;most improved&quot; - every year that passes the cup quality seems to improve. Despite its small geographic size I also find great variety in the coffee from the country. . The particular coffee in question is called &quot;Prince&quot; - after Prince Bigayimpunzi who was a significant individual to the history of coffee farming in the Tangara region. As last week the varietal is a Bourbon, in particular red Bourbon. According to googlemaps this coffee was grown around 200km away from last weeks Rwandan &quot;Bingo&quot; - given they&#39;re both Bourbon varietals and naturally processed we would assume that the coffees would be remarkably similar: this is not the case. The Rwandan was polite, refined and not at all funky. In contrast the Burundi Prince is a wild child! . As I like to start with any coffee: on the nose we are punched in the face with berry fruitiness! It is really quite striking and is certainly intense. There are some supporting notes there too, a chocolate-y sort of smell and it gives the impression of &quot;sweetness&quot; but first impressions are this will be an acidity bomb! There is not a huge amount of &quot;funk&quot; on the nose, in fact it&#39;s difficult to really tell it&#39;s a natural. Based on smell alone I might guess it is a washed Kenyan, it gives off that sort of acidic fruit-bomb vibe. . Moving on, as always, to the filter: again I rely on my trusty Hasami Brewer. I&#39;ve not written much about brewed coffee yet in this blog so I will take a brief de-tour to talk about my set up and how I approach filter. . At heart I will always be a &quot;filter-boy&quot; - it is what first attracted me to coffee and is my most common form of coffee. I particularly love it for judging coffees as the coffees really speak for themselves when presented this way. I have tried (and still use) many different types of brewer, drip, pour-over, infusion, you name it! But for many years for me Chemex was king. One thing I always look for in a coffee is cleanliness, that is the quality I hunt down most - it is why I favour (much) lighter roasts than many. The Chemex with the very thick filter papers accentuates this quality in a coffee so it has always been a favourite of mine. If the pour-over world is split into Chemex and v60 fans I am firmly in the former camp! I also think as an item the chemex is a beautiful item to behold and an iconic design - I am a firm believer that we first taste with our eyes. Having a beautiful brewer/decanter and mug will improve how you perceive your coffee. . . However I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the performance of Chemex brewers. I find them quite finnicky and have a few issues. Most notably is that the &quot;funnel&quot; walls are smooth, this can cause the filter paper to &quot;stick&quot; to the sides and create a vacuum preventing the water from passing through the coffee. The pouring lip is meant to prevent this however it doesn&#39;t always work. It is certainly not an issue that affects every Chemex brew but it happens enough to make you angry when it does. Another issue I have with the Chemex is the glass walls mean heat escapes quickly, I believe the trick to good filter coffee is keeping things as warm as possible but the Chemex makes this a losing battle. Perhaps worst of all however is that the funnel and carafe are joined together and the neck is narrow, trying to clean a Chemex gets frustrating fast and they quickly look tatty. Not to mention how fragile they are, if you drop one it&#39;s likely it&#39;s gone for good! . My solution for a while was to instead use the v60 brewer and carafe but use the thicker Chemex papers. This is a fair compromise, the v60 has swirling &quot;ridges&quot; that reduce the chance of the paper sticking to the walls. You can pick up a plastic v60 cone for very little money so it is cost effective and long lasting. However unless you spend considerably more I don&#39;t find the v60 particularly visually appealing. About a year ago I came across the Hasami brewer, having bought some of their saucers to use for my espresso cups: . . It has a definite &quot;style&quot; but I am a big fan of the way it looks and feels. Like the v60 it has &quot;ridges&quot; (but straight instead of swirling) but they are deeper so if anything more effective. The brewer itself is &quot;insulating&quot; in the sense that it is made of hollow ceramic/porcelain which helps heat retention. It also comes with a &quot;lid&quot; that I like to place on between pours to further prevent heat loss (I&#39;ve not tested the efficacy of this but it makes me feel better!) It is also an easy clean which is a big plus. The Chemex papers provide a good fit. Overall I&#39;m very happy with it (although I do appreciate it is a very expensive brewer not offering much in the way of tangible benefit to a v60!) . My filter technique is generally quite simple and I do not change it very often. With filter I feel that if you&#39;re trying to &quot;dial in&quot; every coffee you&#39;re doing something wrong - you should look for a consistent technique that you can easily repeat. My technique involves (typically) getting the water very hot, I tend to set my kettle to 100c (although for certain coffees I might knock that back a few degrees depending). My grind setting is constant for all coffees, I do not vary it to target a specific drawdown time. I follow a &quot;pulse pour&quot; approach. I like to pour a small amount of water every 15-20s in order to keep the water level low in the brewer - I find this helps keep the extraction levels higher and helps with consistency. Unlike most others I do not favour agitation of the brew; the extraction yield isn&#39;t quite as high but for me the quality improves. The no-agitation approach increases clarity and cleanliness which is generally my main aim. For a typical cup I will use 14-15g coffee and 200g water - this ratio is a little higher than some suggest but it is where I like it, I feel the little extra coffee makes up for the lack of agitation in terms of total extraction but you end up with a cleaner cup out of it. I might pour 40g, leave for 30s then pour 20g of water every 15s as a typical recipe. Between pours I put the kettle back on to heat up if it needs it and I will place the Hasami lid on to reduce the amount of heat loss. . Back onto the coffee in question after this detour into the world of brewing: as a filter this coffee is fairly wild! The acidity is very prominent from the get go. Blackberries and redcurrants come through strong but this is balanced by a chocolate note and a sweet butterscotch taste and mouthfeel. It is an interesting cup for sure, very complex. Of the long and shorts this is my choice as a filter, it is just more &quot;my style&quot;. As is often the case with Burundi&#39;s there is a floral note I can&#39;t quite put my finger on also, I have a hard time describing it and it&#39;s not particularly loud but it is there. . Moving onto the espresso: again this is a wild child! The long and short roast profile again is more developed than my &quot;typical&quot; coffees which makes it very easy to pull shots from. If you wanted a &quot;gateway drug&quot; to the wilder more acidic espressos I don&#39;t think this one would be a bad starting point as it is so forgiving. Again the acidic blackberry-redcurrant notes are in the forefront and are by far most dominant. The acidity offers almost a &quot;drying&quot; experience in the mouth (but not in a bad way). There is enough sweetness to balance things out but it is not something I can really pinpoint down as a &quot;sugar&quot; or &quot;caramel&quot; or &quot;chocolate&quot; its just there to balance things. In terms of mouthfeel and body there is not much to talk about it is fairly &quot;thin&quot; - some may not like that but I&#39;ve never really placed much value on body. It is certainly a clean cup and thoroughly enjoyable. Again there is that floral note lingering in the aftertaste that I wish I could put a finger on, maybe I&#39;ll have to try some more floral tasting foods to try and really dig down into what this &quot;Burundi note&quot; is! . Just as this weeks coffee is a wild-child we also look at a wild album as this weeks jazz pairing: Angles 9 - Injuries. . . I have to admit I do not know a huge amount about the various &quot;Angles&quot; bands (led by saxaphonist Martin KÃ¼chen), there are many incarcerations in many &quot;sizes&quot; - this album being a nonet - or nine piece. This places it firmly in the &quot;big band&quot; camp, something I feel is being under-represented currently. This particular album was released in 2014 and was my first exposure to this band. The full personel are: . Alexander Zethson - piano | Andreas Werliin - drums | Eirik Hegdal - baritone sax | Goran Kajfes - cornet | Johan Berthling - bass | Magnus Broo - trumpet | Martin KÃ¼chen - alto and tenor sax | Mats Aleklint - trombone | Mattias StÃ¥hl - vibraphone | . The music itself is more at the &quot;free&quot; end of jazz (which in itself is odd for a big-band) - but there is still great focus on creating a groove, this is &quot;free jazz&quot; for those that enjoy getting up on their feet and dancing. Some of the playing is wild and ferocious, intellectually stimulating and challenging. Yet they manage to keep thrings under control by not losing sight of the groove and relying on the occassional minimalist section to allow the music to breathe. This is a great example of why &quot;free jazz&quot; can still rely on great composition. . Angles 9 have a sound completely of their own, you can identify them within a playlist almost instantly. To me this is the sign of a great artist. Their sound is neither too modern nor too dated, it is just right in that sweetspot where you have some familiarity but it is not &quot;boring&quot;. You can tell every musician in the group plays with swagger and has complete confidence in each others abilities, if the musicians were even slightly on edge the whole thing would fall apart into one big mess. . The opening track (embedded above) &quot;European Boogie&quot; is an absolute fire-cracker that sets the stage for the rest of the album. It is bombastic, swinging and with just the right amount of ego. It also shows that this project is not just content on making music, they&#39;re also trying to make a statement as many of the earlier free-jazz adopters were. However unlike the negative outlook many jazz artists take (and rightly so) - this album presents celebration, peace and hope at the forefront. They manage to combine many cultures into the music seemlessly, from the African and Latin inspired percussive beats through European classically inspired melodies. It is &quot;fusion&quot; in the true sense of the word. The track &quot;Eti&quot; is another particular highlight of the album for me, it really captures the celebrative euphoria and just straight having fun. This is punctuated by the more minimalist freer sections, as if to show that &quot;low periods&quot; help accentuate the joy when it is there. What is also remarkable about this track is also the strength of the main theme, the melody itself reminds me of Russian classical pieces in particular. There are not many &quot;free&quot; albums where you will be humming the melody for days after you hear it. There are even fewer free-jazz albums that you feel like dancing too (admittedly a strange sort of dancing!) . The album is released on the Clean Feed record label out of Lisbon, Portugal. In recent years I have found this to be a highly dependable label. I like labels to have their own &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;style&quot;, this is something that the early labels had in spades. You can pick up any Blue Note recording from the &#39;50s-60s and you know what to expect. Cleanfeed does not hark back to the &quot;good old days&quot; trotting out tried and tested music, they&#39;re very ambitious. The music tends to be very free and experimental but never for the sake of it. It also helps that their recording quality is always top notch too, again they&#39;re progressive and modern - they aim for a very &quot;clean&quot; hi-fi quality to recording, not putting any &quot;faux-patina&quot; on during the recording to conjur up nostalgia. Yet the records remain open and warm, never cold nor clinical. Something that&#39;s very hard to do. . All in all &quot;Injuries&quot; can only be described, in this author&#39;s opinion, as a modern masterpiece. I don&#39;t like to make claims of &quot;album of the decade&quot; or similarly grandiose terms but for jazz released in the 2010s this has to be up there in any &quot;best of&quot; list. It is mindboggling to me this album did not get wide recognition. . I will leave with the track from the album: &quot;Ubabba&quot;. It is the least &quot;free&quot; of all the tracks but shows this band can still swing as hard as anybody else out there! Albeit in their very unique styling. After listening to free-jazz it&#39;s often nice to end on something more straight as a pallette cleanser: And there we have it: a wild coffee in Prince from Long and Short and some wild jazz from the boys in Angles 9. .",

            "title": "Fat Albert Rotunda and Long and Short Bingo",
            "content": "In this blog we are sticking with the Long and Short roastery ( https://longandshort.london/ ) from last time. Again we have another natural processed coffee, this time a Bourbon varietal from Rwanda called &quot;Bingo&quot; (with cupping score 87). . Typically Rwanda is known for their washed coffees, so it is a little unusual to find a natural coffee from there - not exceedingly so, but enough to be note worthy. The bourbon varietal is certainly ubiquitous throughout Rwanda however. Coffee varietals are important in the same way grape types are important to wine. From a preservation standpoint varietals are also important for genetic diversity, currently coffee plants are not particularly diverse and so highly susceptible to pests and disease. The creation of new varietals might help coffee survive long term. . Ethiopia is widely regarded as the birthplace of coffee and it is has the highest diversity of varietals (~95% of all varietals can be found in Ethiopia by some estimates). Outside of Ethiopia most coffee varietals can trace back to Yemen where there existed 2 main varietals: Typica and Bourbon (which is itself a mutation of Typica). Essentially every coffee outside of Ethiopia can trace its lineage back to Typica or Bourbon. . Bourbon takes its name from the island of Bourbon (now RÃ©union) where it was originally grown before being exported by the French to Latin America and Africa. Compared to Typica the Bourbon varietal has a higher yield (although still low yield compared to many other varietals.) Both are renowned for producing good quality coffee, unfortunately both types are highly susceptible to pests and disease which makes them hard to grow. Bourbon is in some sense &quot;the specialty coffee varietal&quot; given its prevelance and enduring popularity. To continue the wine analogy: &quot;Bourbon is the pinot-noir of the coffee world!&quot; The varietal can be further broken down into &quot;red bourbon&quot; (the original bourbon), &quot;yellow bourbon&quot; (a natural mutation of the red bourbon) and more recently &quot;orange/pink bourbon&quot; (another natural mutation). The colour names refer to the appearance of the coffee fruit prior to processing. . Onto Bingo itself: on the nose the beans give off a strong, rich caramel/burnt sugar sort of vibe - certainly enticing! As with the previous Long and Short coffee the roast level is what I would describe as a true medium-light: not a really light delicate filter roast but also not a medium where you start to see &quot;roasty&quot; notes that mask the natural acidity and sweetness in the coffee. As a filter this coffee shows a reasonable amount of complexity, there&#39;s certainly a tea note present which is strong upfront but also lingers as an aftertaste. The caramel note on the nose is also there but plays more of a supporting role. The real intrigue in the coffee is the blend of the sweetness and acidity - on the bag they describe it as &quot;bittersweet&quot; which is a very good description. As an espresso we are treated with a decent amount of mouthfeel and body. With this one I found pulling a little shorter helped stop the tastes getting lost. The flavour profile in the espresso is much like the filter although the caramel note is amplified somewhat and the tea note dialed back (especially in the aftertaste). All in all an enjoyable cup! . One thing we normally associate with natural coffees is &quot;funk&quot;, this coffee is not particularly funky. But this week&#39;s album is: . Originally appearing as the soundtrack to Bill Cosby&#39;s animated special &quot;Hey, Hey, Hey, It&#39;s Fat Albert&quot;. and released in 1969 &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; was Herbie Hancock&#39;s first dalliance with jazz-funk, a sound he would come back to with &quot;Head Hunters&quot; in 1973. Upto this point Herbie was known for his sophisticated harmony in more &quot;classic&quot; jazz settings and for his &quot;fusion&quot; work with Miles. &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; was instead heavily influenced by funk and soul music. . The album features quite a large ensemble cast of: . Herbie Hancock: Piano, Eletric Piano | Joe Henderson: Tenor Sax, Alto-flute | Garnett Brown: trombone | Johnny Coles: trumpet, flugelhorn | Buster Williams: electric, acoustic bass | Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath: drums | George Devens: percussion | . With additional appearances on some tunes. Having such a large core-band really adds to the funk/soul vibe and affords Herbie more freedom in arrangement. Again blog-favourite Joe Henderson appears to provide some fire-breathing solos, the funky backdrop allows him to show off some funky chops and get a little freer. This is Joe&#39;s 3rd appearance in 8 blog posts - no other blog offers as much Joe Henderson per square inch! . The album starts with &quot;Wiggle Waggle&quot; (embedded above), which is an all time classic. It&#39;s a tune I feel many people will recognise but may not attribute to Herbie, like a few other tunes in his repertoire. It is based around a simple 12 bar blues guitar riff with the horns providing embellishments. The music really grooves with an r&amp;b/soul vibe and Joe&#39;s solo is a wild start to an album. If you can listen to this track without, at least, tapping your feet you should probably go to your doctor and get them to check if you&#39;re missing the funk gene. . I usually find jazz artists tend to express themselves in one of three ways: some are melody driven, some are harmony driven and some are rhythmically driven. Herbie is part of a rare breed that is adept at all three and this album displays this. After listening you&#39;ll find yourself humming the melody of some of the pieces and while it&#39;s playing you&#39;ll get intoxicated with the groove. To break up the funk however there are a few harmonically rich jazz pieces. My choice cut being &quot;Jessica&quot; on side 2: Which showcases Herbie&#39;s skill for harmonic composition and arrangement, a piece he revisited on 1977s &quot;V.S.O.P&quot; album. It is one of my favourite Hancock compositions, it is made all the more striking and beautiful on &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; where it is bookended by &quot;Oh! OH! Here He Comes&quot; and the title track - both of which are fat greasy funk grooves through and through. . Another track of note is the 2nd on the first side: &quot;Fat Mama&quot;. The distorted guitar groove with more than a passing resemblance to &quot;Cissy Strut&quot; by The Meters (which was released around the same time). Instead of being pure Meters funk there is more sophistication in &quot;Fat Mama&quot; (as to be expected with Hancock). . Herbie is still out touring regularly and I have been fortunate enough to see him a few times live (I remember a duet gig with Chick Corea being particularly good!) Since he is such an &quot;all-star&quot; in the jazz world I&#39;ve only seen him in larger concert halls, I&#39;d love to get a chance to see him in a more intimate &quot;jazz club&quot; setting, although a gig like that would sell out almost instantly so I may need to take out a mortgage to fund tickets from a tout if that ever happens here in London. . The weather in London today is overcast and grey, strong winds and intermittent rain showers. On days like this you need comforting coffee and uplifting music: Bingo and &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; it is. .",

            "title": "The Natural Soul and Long and Short Dambi Udo",
            "content": "In this blog post we&#39;re going &quot;natural&quot;. At the moment I&#39;m finding most of the interesting coffees out there, at least the ones catching my eye, are naturals so it seems only fitting to embrace that. . To those that may be new to the coffee world by &quot;natural&quot; we are referring to how the coffee is processed before being roasted. A coffee &quot;bean&quot; is in fact a seed inside a coffee cherry fruit. The job of processing is to remove this fruit so that the beans are dried and ready to roast (and ultimately end up in tasty and delicious drinks). One option is &quot;washed&quot; processing where, as the name suggests, the coffee cherry is removed with water. Of all the processing methods this produces the &quot;cleanest&quot; cup since (essentially) all the cherry is removed. A &quot;natural&quot; processing method however involves leaving the bean inside the coffee cherry longer, typically in the sun. The natural sugars in the fruit ferment during this time. Eventually the fruit is seperated from the seed, producers have some control over how long the drying stage takes which can impact the qualities in the cup. Typically natural coffees are more complex, have bolder and wilder flavour profiles typically at the expense of being &quot;clean&quot;. In some cases where the fermentation stage is particularly long the coffee can take on &quot;funky&quot; characteristics, I tend to associate these with &quot;bruised fruit&quot; or &quot;fortified alcohol&quot; flavour notes. In the extreme they can taste slightly &quot;rotten&quot; which is a bit of a marmite thing, I&#39;ve not found many really funky naturals for a few years though. . The coffee in question this week comes from the Long and Short ( https://longandshort.london/ ) team in Walthamstow East London. I&#39;ve never purchased from these guys before but what caught my eye was an understated aesthetic and some rather high-quality coffees for reasonable prices. Coffee quality is often assessed using an SCA cupping score ranging from 0-100, to be called specialty the coffee needs a score of at least 80. The cupping score is not perfect but I find is a reasonable benchmark if looking at a new roaster. Typically I&#39;ll look for a score of around 87 or higher, this seems a good yardstick for me - going into the 90s typically means spending much much more dropping down to near 80 does not reduce the cost too much, it is a bit of a sweetspot in the diminishing return curve. To sweeten the deal Long and Short offer 20% off a first order if you sign up to their newsletter. Their regular prices are fair but 20% off is unbelievable - I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get much more bang for your buck, they must be selling at cost with the discount. . . The coffee I selected was called Dambi Udo, it is an Ethiopian from the Guji region and has an SCA score of 89. It is worth noting however that a single score like this cannot tell you anything about the flavour profile or even if you&#39;ll enjoy a coffee. If you hate really bright acidic cup profiles regardless of the SCA score a washed Kenyan might not be the one for you! Ethiopian naturals are really a &quot;tale of 2 halves&quot; in my experience - on the one side you get some really elegant fairly clean cups and on the other you can end up with complete madness (one of my most memorable cups of coffee ever was a particularly funky Yirgacheffe natural, it was right on the edge of being too &quot;rotten&quot; tasting but was a really smash in the face of flavours). The Dambi Udo is definitely on the more polite and elegant end of things. . in the interests of honesty this coffee is roasted slightly darker than my typical coffees. It is by no means dark, a medium-light is more of a fair description but I tend to go light to very light in my preferences. However by developing a bit further the acidity can be managed slightly. The result here is a very easy to drink cup that is very balanced, I&#39;m not feeling as though I&#39;m sacrificing anything by going a touch darker than usual. This also makes pulling espresso shots so much easier, I find this coffee incredibly forgiving - it&#39;s basically impossible to pull a bad shot if you get at least within the ballpark of a reasonable &quot;recipe&quot;. I find this one likes to be ground a bit coarser than others (like many natural Ethiopians in my experience) and only a medium sort of heat. I have had good results from pulling very short (1.85:1) to fairly long (2.5:1) - living up to the Long and Short name! . Onto the cup itself. After grinding the beans have a caramel and jammy sort of vibe on the nose for me along with some very delicate floral notes, very enticing. On the eyes the beans are quite clearly natural (I find there is a certain &quot;look&quot; to natural coffees) but on the nose there isn&#39;t a typical natural funk. In the filter we find the natural processing imparting body and mouthfeel which is really satisfying. The flavour profile is fruity though and through, there are tropical fruits like mangos and watermelons but also a blueberry type note. The caramel on the nose goes more to a sugar-syrup or jam in the cup, there isn&#39;t a hint of a &quot;roasty&quot; note. In the espresso I find this coffee amps up the jam even more both in texture and flavour. The floral notes also come out to play, if I had to describe the type I&#39;d suggest elderflower is an apt descriptor. The acidity is not too high at all in my opinion, I could see this being a good gateway for those that find African espresso too acidic. . If you&#39;re looking for a satisfying cup that is complex yet not too challenging I&#39;d certainly recommend the Dambi Udo. Especially for the discounted price it is truly exceptional. I also want to make a couple of shout-outs about Long and Short: . They win the record for the quickest turnaround of an order I can remember. From placing the order I got the tracking information for delivery within 17mins. Very very good! | It is nice to see packaging that is recyclable, many coffee bags are a pain to recycle but these bags can go into regular recycling (with the 2-way valve removed) | . The album in this blog is one slightly (but not massively) under the radar the 1962: &quot;The Natural Soul&quot; by Lou Donaldson. . The cover art is fairly typical in style with the black/white picture being brought to life with a flash of colour and the impactful block lettering. Lou Donaldson albums are somewhat synonomous with featuring beautiful women on the covers, but I believe this is the first one (jazz historians feel free to correct this!) &quot;The Natural Soul&quot; would have been all the more striking at the time for featuring an African-American woman with a &quot;natural&quot; afro hairstyle, kudos to Blue Note records for being willing to create cover art like this. . The music on this album represents one of the first &quot;Soul-Jazz&quot; records that came in the post-bop era for which Lou Donaldson was a major artist. Soul-Jazz focussed less on intense musicianship and blistering lead lines and more on groove taking inspiration from soul and r&#39;n&#39;b. The tunes were mostly variations on a blues or simply a one-chord vamp and the solos were all about blues-y lyricism. . The line-up on this album is simply incredible, Lou on alto, Tommy Turretine on trumpet, Grant Green on guitar, Big John Patton on organ and Ben Dixon on the drums. The Green/Patton/Dixon trio at the time being one of the pre-eminent organ trios around with a reputation for being one of the funkiest/grooviest. . The music presented is firmly in the Soul-Jazz tradition but with more than a foot remaining rooted in the blues. The opening track &quot;Funky Mama&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) is a perfect example with a hard hitting Soul-Jazz groove based around a 12 bar-blues. Most of the compositions take the form of a turnaround - for any musicians wanting to navigate a turnaround this album (along with many in the Donaldson catalogue) is a great place to start. Lou uses simple pentatonic blues phrases to great effect throughout, Green uses his minimalist style to keep the groove going and Big John Patton acts as the rock keeping things moving. To simply label the playing as &quot;simple blues&quot; is a mistake however, there is still plenty of bop virtuosity on display for example in the opening of side 2 &quot;Sow Belly Blues&quot; where the soloists let loose a bit more. Lou Donaldson (nickname &quot;Sweet Papa&quot;) was also known for his humour and this is certainly on display throughout the album with upbeat progressions and jokey expressions (although the music is anything but a joke). I was fortunate enough to see him live a few years ago, at the time he was nearing 90 years old but still put in a hell of a show. He may have needed to sit down, rest and take trips back stage while others were soloing but it was still a memorable gig. His humour was on display that night and he said 2 things that I will always remember: . &quot;This next tune is a Miles Davis number... You know, back when he actually played jazz.&quot; | A long talk about how in his old age his &quot;performance&quot; was suffering and his experiments with viagra (some of which cannot be printed in a family oriented blog like this!) | A great character, great performer and all around nice guy. He no longer performs live (at 93 years old at time of writing) so I feel fortunate to have got a chance to see him. . So if you&#39;re in search of something fairly easy to listen to that doesn&#39;t compromise on musicianship while providing fat grooves: &quot;The Natural Soul&quot; is not a bad way to go about it. .",

            "title": "Graffiti and PLOT Panchita Irureta",
            "content": "This weeks jazz album is the 2015 offering from JD Allen: Graffiti. I wanted to feature a more modern offering this time. In jazz it is all too easy to get caught up in history and yearn for the &quot;good old days&quot;, as such many modern artists seem to get overlooked. JD Allen is one such example, in my opinion one of the greatest modern players who deserves much more recognition for the work he is putting out. (This is exemplified by his allmusic.com entry which is woefully sparse and is missing all of his releases post 2013!) . . Seeing jazz being performed live is one of lifes great experiences, it is great listening to the old Blue Note records but nothing compares to the thrill of a great gig. I have seen JD a few times when he has performed in London, everytime a fantastic performance. Some artists rely on stage patter to lift performances, JD (and his group) does not instead letting the music speak for itself. This almost forces you to really pay attention to the music itself and the whole room feels &quot;part of something&quot;. If he is performing in your neighbourhood I&#39;d wholly recommend getting a ticket. . The album itself (Graffiti) is one of my favourites from him. It features Rudy Royston on drums and Greg August on bass, this rhythm section featuring on many Allen recordings upto 2019s &quot;Barracoon&quot; where he brought in some fresh blood. . The music on Graffiti walks that fine line between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot;, sometimes straying to an almost &quot;free&quot; structure but then pulling you back into something more comfortable. However there is a strong backbone of blues to everything to keep you grounded. There is almost a sensation of movement to the music, you can feel yourself being pushed and pulled by some external force as the music weaves between the swinging and the chaotic. . Many modern band leaders like to express themselves through dense harmonic structures, the music can feel somewhat rigid as a result as this closes off many avenues for improvisation since any solo has to essentially be a regimented tap dance to avoid falling down. This can be fun, but Graffiti instead keeps a looser feeling. Instead of relying on harmony for expression JDs music relies on rhythm to make a statement. . One of my favourite cuts on the album is the 2nd track: &quot;Jawn Henry&quot;. Allen&#39;s playing with the use of wolf tones in the main melody and the overall vibe reminds me of Joe Henderson (who is one of my all time favourite players). It has its own thing going however, there is the very evident JD DNA through the whole piece. Rudy&#39;s quite chaotic drumming helps fill the space in the composition and shows off some monster chops. Despite the technicality however Rudy manages to maintain a solid groove and swing which is no mean feat. With so much going on with the sax and drums you need a bedrock to keep things under control and this is where August comes in. You can tell this band is totally comfortable with each other, with music like this it can quickly turn into disaster if the band isn&#39;t tight. The track is a good illustration of the &quot;out but in&quot; vibe that JDs music is all about. . All the tracks on the album are solid, it is very consistent start to finish. It does not feel like any track is there as filler to turn an EP into an LP. The closing track &quot;Disambiguation&quot; reprises the main theme from &quot;Jawn Henry&quot; and acts to tie the whole album together and acts as a resolution leaving the listener satisfied. Some other tracks I particularly enjoy on the album are &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; which has some real swagger to it (and based on the name I assume is a tribute to Sonny Rollins who is clearly an influence). Another piece that sticks out is &quot;Indigo (Blue Like)&quot;, in the liner notes JD says: &quot;the most avant-garde thing that a jazz musician could do today is try to straight up and down swing&quot; and he is totally right. This tune swings hard but with some Monk inflections and humour thrown in along the way, you can tell they had great fun recording this. If you&#39;re looking for some &quot;no-nonsense&quot; hard hitting modern jazz that respects the past but isn&#39;t a prisoner to it; check out &quot;Graffiti&quot; through whichever medium you use to purchase your music. . The coffee this week is the last of my current batch from PLOT a Peruvian: &quot;Panchita Irureta Atipanaku Competition Lot&quot;. It is a fully washed Caturra coffee. Peru is not an origin I naturally gravitate towards, but for any real reason. Maybe it&#39;s just their seasonality coinciding with other origins that I favour. . As a filter you are greeted with a fairly rich and very sweet cup. Notes coming through cherry and a dark forest gateaux sort of vibe. There is also a reasonable amount of mouthfeel, texture and body to the cup. Both the flavour profile and the mouthfeel don&#39;t scream &quot;washed&quot; you would more naturally associate these things with some sort of natural processing, which is kind of interesting. On the acidity scale I would classify it as a medium, leaning more to sweetness than acidity on a sweet-acid scale. It&#39;s certainly an intriguing cup but despite the complexities it is (very) easy to drink and quite satisfying. . I have to admit I have struggled to dial in a great espresso with this coffee. It&#39;s not that the coffee is &quot;unforgiving&quot; (like say a light roast washed Kenyan that ends up like battery acid if you&#39;re not careful) - it is fairly easy to get something nice to drink, but getting it to shine took a bit of work. I&#39;m used to dialing in very light roasts (and this is a filter roast afterall and probably on the lighter end of filters even) - I eventually found something that works but it is a little counter-intuitive. Although this coffee is a light washed I found it better to think of it as a medium roast natural coffee (somewhat mimicking its flavour profile in the filter I guess). . My espresso machine is a Londinium-R lever machine. It is a fairly simple machine based around a spring-loaded lever group. It has the addition of a digital pre-infusion module that allows you to vary the pressure of the pre-infusion stage which is akin to changing the temperature on some other machines. This pre-infusion pressure is the only variable you really have with this machine. Personally I think this is great, I am not a fan of profiling machines in general as I feel you always end up with a sense of &quot;if only I varied XXXX a bit I could make this better&quot; - which leads to a lot of wasted coffee. . . For the bright filter roasts I use for espresso a general rule to follow for the best results is to get the machine very hot and pull a long shot (~2.5:1 typically) quickly (~22s). This does not work for this coffee however, following this procedure and you&#39;re left with something quite muted and flat. The major issue seems to be the heat, this coffee does not like heat at all! I dialed back to a temperature more suited to a medium roast espresso and things began to liven up. I than began to systematically fine the grind up a bit, reduce the volume of the shot and extend the time. I eventually settled on a &quot;typical&quot; espresso recipe of 2:1 in 27s. It&#39;s quite odd to pull a shot like this these days with the sorts of coffee I drink, usually the longest/slowest I&#39;d go is 2.2:1 and 25s and even that is rare. The results of the espresso investigation led me to change my filter technique for this coffee too, I usually set my kettle hot and re-heat between pours. With this coffee I reduced the temperature by 5 degrees celcius and didn&#39;t re-heat, the coffee thanked me for it (but I doubt I&#39;ll be using these settings for my next bag of coffee!) . Once dialled in however the coffee really speaks as an espresso, it&#39;s bold and vibrant with the black forest gateaux hitting you in the face with full force. As in the filter it&#39;s (very) sweet but there isn&#39;t a mountain of acidity. I could imagine this coffee not being too off-putting for those used to a more developed espresso roast, however being roast less means the flavours are incredibly clean. The mouthfeel is quite syrupy with lots of body, again it&#39;s a complex but satisfying affair. . Overall of the 3 PLOT coffees I tried this was (eventually) my favourite espresso of the 3, which is some achievement as they were all great in their own ways. You might need to work at it a bit but I think it&#39;s worth the hassle for the results in the cup! And it is especially to suited to being consumed while listening to JD Allen&#39;s Graffiti. .",

            "title": "Moanin and PLOT Abera Ararso",
            "content": "Following on from the previous blog post; the second coffee from my PLOT order is the Abera Ararso. This is a fully washed Ethiopian coffee from the Yirgacheffe region. Washed Yirgacheffes have become one of the icons of third wave specialty coffee, they tend to have high cup quality and a certain &quot;style&quot;. Over the years we have almost become spoiled by how great they can be. At the moment it&#39;s trendy to have ever more complex fermentations, drying and yeast based processes to gain more &quot;complexity&quot; in the cup - but for me nothing compares to a Yirgacheffe washed coffee. They&#39;re like your favourite jacket that can be dressed up or down, the Yirgacheffe can satisfy your lust for complex flavours yet at the same time is equally suited to when you just want a cup that is easy to drink on a lazy Sunday morning. . This particular example from PLOT is a very floral affair, not the &quot;loudest&quot; coffee you&#39;ll drink compared to say a natural process fruit bomb. However for a floral it still packs a hefty punch. As a filter there is also a fair amount of sweetness in the cup - it reminds me of candied lavender that you get in fancy cocktail bars. The cocktail comparison is probably fairly apt too as the cup oozes of sophistication and elegance. As with most washed Ethiopians there isn&#39;t a whole lot in the way of mouthfeel. As an espresso the florals pop even more especially on the nose - it is a very fragrant espresso. Washed Yirgacheffes are not always favoured for espresso since they can easily get lost in milk and can be a little too polite for some but personally I like them a lot. . On the bag the taste notes are listed as: &quot;Peach, Parma Violets and Bergamot&quot;. I feel these are fairly apt descriptors, the fragrant bergamot notes are particularly prominent to me. I usually try and ignore specifics in flavour notes when choosing coffee to buy, I tend to just look for &quot;trends&quot; for example: is the coffee floral? Stone fruits? Tropical fruits? and so on rather than hunting down a very specific note. I often seen new coffee drinkers post online &quot;I can&#39;t taste the XXXXX note, what have I done wrong?&quot; which I think leads to disappointment. I think the SCA&#39;s attempt to standardize taste descriptors through the flavour wheel is helpful as I feel as though the industry has got a bit carried away in recent years. Can anybody really tell me they can taste the difference between a coffee with a &quot;strawberry&quot; note versus one with a &quot;wild strawberry&quot; note? I feel as though these grandiose descriptors just lead to disappointment and turns more people away than attracts them to specialty. (Note: this is no reflection on PLOT who seem to use reasonable descriptions, it is just a topic that has been on my mind recently). . . One positive trend I&#39;ve seen with Ethiopian coffees in the past year or so is the movement away from the &quot;Heirloom&quot; varietal - for those readers who perhaps aren&#39;t as well versed in their terminology: a coffee varietal is roughly the equivalent to a grape variety in a wine. So while in wine you might have a chardonnay, pinot noir or malbec grape in a coffee you might have typica, red bourbon or caturra varietals. Ethiopia is widely considered the birthplace of coffee and occurs &quot;naturally&quot;, in other regions the coffee plants were introduced. By introducing specific strains and careful farming outside of Ethiopia it is fairly easy to identify the specific varietals on a particular farm. In Ethiopia the coffee plants are much much older, they have naturally evolved over time and so an individual farm may have many different varietals mixed together, some of which may never have even been classified. In the past the industry used the term &quot;Heirloom&quot; to denote an Ethiopian coffee with a &quot;mix&quot; of natural varietals. This is not ideal since different farms can be composed of entirely different varietals yet both be labelled the same. In the past year or so there has been a move to classify these varietals better. In the Abera Ararso from PLOT we have Kume, Diga and Wolisho varietals. Being relatively new names I haven&#39;t yet got a good handle on the characteristics of each - but hopefully in time I can gain a better understanding of these differences. . Since this weeks coffee is a classic, it feels only apt to pick one of the classic albums in Jazz history to pair with it. In this case I have settled on Moanin&#39; by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. . . The Jazz Messengers have a long and complicated history, originally formed via a partnership between drummer Art Blakey and pianist Horace Silver who left after a couple of years to lead solo projects under his own name. Thereafter Blakey became the leader and director of the group (but also released some music under his own name). Under Blakey the Jazz Messengers had a reputation for attracting young talent and &quot;making them stars&quot;. The groups alumni include some of the greatest names in jazz and one would have to include Blakey in any list of &quot;greatest band leaders&quot;. The Blakey mantra to band leading was to find talented youngsters and then &quot;getting out of their way&quot; rather than using the &quot;apprentice&quot; model that other senior band leaders often favour. . On this record the &quot;big name&quot; is Lee Morgan who would have been 20 years old at the time of recording, already having some noteriety from appearing on Coltrane&#39;s &quot;Blue Train&quot; a year or so earlier. However it wasn&#39;t until a few years after the release of &quot;Moanin&#39;&quot; that he became a household name. Although not quite having, in hindsight, the star power of Morgan the other musicians on the record are no slouches either: Benny Golson on tenor sax, Bobby Timmons on piano and Jymie Merritt on the bass. . As with most LPs on the Blue Note record label from the 50s and 60s Moanin&#39; features an iconic cover with the classic Reid Miles block lettering and a rather sombre looking Blakey (who is usually much more upbeat) in a photo by Francis Wolff. The Blue Note DNA runs through to the music too; during this time recording and rehearsal was relatively expensive. As a result many records released on other labels featured track lists mainly consisting of standards that they could record quickly in few takes. In contrast Alfred Lion and Blue Note paid for rehearsal time for the artists which allowed them to be more creative and develop new music. The album here featuring only one standard: Johnny Mercer&#39;s &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; as the final track, and even that has been largely reworked. All other tracks being originals. . The music itself is gutsy, soulful and with a clear influence from blues and gospel music. The late 50s was an interesting time for jazz music in general, be-bop had started to become a little stale. Artists were trying to find a new voice. Shortly after this jazz began to fragment into new sub-genres (as is the case with any music that lasts long enough). Blakey grew up with big bands and later became associated with be-bop groups - through the Jazz Messengers he became one of the figureheads of the hard-bop movement combining some of the hard hitting swing of big band with some of the dense harmonic structures of be-bop. . The album starts off with the title-track penned by Timmons, the opening motif being one of the most powerful and recognisable in all of jazz. Everybody on the record is on top form and they were clearly up for it. From Blakey&#39;s muscular powerful swinging groove, Timmons offering blues-y block chords and Lee Morgan offering up some killer soulful solos offering a glimpse of what is to come in his later career. The whole record has swagger, swing and total confidence - this is important in jazz records, the musicians often take great risks harmonically and played without confidence it leaves the listener on edge. Part of the beauty of jazz is the feeling of being &quot;in safe hands&quot; while doing something completely reckless. . Other high points on this album, if we can even pick high-points given every cut on the album is a classic, is &quot;Along Came Betty&quot; on side 2 written by Golson. It is perhaps the most sophisticated track on the album with an almost Ellingon-esque horn arrangement. Blakey&#39;s energy lifts the soloists to new heights however, Golson in particular plays out of his skin on this one. If you&#39;re looking for a reminder of why the classics are classics because, maybe, you have become a bit complacent you can&#39;t go far wrong with either Abera Ararso from PLOT nor &quot;Moanin&#39;&quot; from Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. .",

            "title": "Point Of Departure and PLOT Rodrigo Sanchez Valencia",
            "content": "The main impetus behind this blog post is a new coffee I have been drinking recently. . The coffee in question is from the folks at PLOT Roasting ( https://plotroasting.com/ ). I believe they are a relatively new roaster on the scene, starting around the mid-end of 2019 based in Woolwich east London. I&#39;m usually quite suspicious of new roasters and usually like to try their offerings in cafes before purchasing a whole bag. The past few years quite a few sub-par roasters have appeared in London. What made me try PLOT then? For one their website suggested they know what they&#39;re doing and there appeared to be a coherent brand and aim - not a list of specialty cliches. The service was good with quick delivery and a hand written thank you note, which although doesn&#39;t change the drinking experience I appreciate when I see it. The packaging is very nice also, you build up your expectations prior to even viewing the beans so it&#39;s nice to see nice well thought out packaging (although packaging alone will not save a subpar coffee of course!) . The coffee itself I&#39;m writing about today is from Huila, Colombia and is called: Rodrigo Sanchez Valencia. There are 2 main pieces of interest on the spec sheet: the first the varietal is (entirely) pink bourbon - a hybrid between red and yellow bourbons (there also exists another hybrid orange bourbon). This varietal is super-rare and hard to produce so you don&#39;t often see it and when you do it tends to be expensive. PLOT however price this, in my opinion, fairly reasonably - higher than average but not to crazy-Geisha levels. The second point of interest is the processing method: a washed cold fermented processing. Essentially the coffee is picked and pulped then stored to ferment at a low temperature for a few days and then treated as a fully washed coffee would be. This is the first coffee of this processing type I have tried to the best of my knowledge, my instinct tells me to expect the funky notes of a natural but without the &quot;body&quot; and &quot;dirt&quot; you get with a natural. I have to admit I am not a big fan of some of these fancy new processing techniques, while interesting and different I don&#39;t find many to be particularly enjoyable - I often find a certain &quot;hollowness&quot; or &quot;emptiness&quot; to these coffees that sort of reminds me a decaf. . . Into the cup we go, starting with the filter - using my goto rig of the OE Apex, Hasami brewer and chemex paper. The ground beans have a different texture between the fingers from the last few coffees I&#39;ve had, a more jagged and &quot;dry&quot; feeling - I&#39;m not sure if this is directly attributable to the processing, varietal or just coincidence. On the nose the beans give off a very wiry almost vinegar aroma - certainly &quot;different&quot; but not unpleasant. Brewing to my usual recipe the first thing I notice in the cup is a cider smell - like a cloudy &quot;craft&quot; cider as opposed to a mass produced cider. This carries through to the cup, there is a fair amount of acidity present. The sweetness is there but it&#39;s certainly on the acidic end of the scale. The boozy funkiness from the fermentation only amplifies the cider comparisons. The body and mouthfeel are very light and thin, it is certainly an odd experience since the funky notes tend to come with increased body. As an espresso I get much the same qualities, this is certainly not an espresso for those looking for a more traditional and developed espresso (note: I believe PLOT only suggests this for filter - but I like low development espressos). There are some light other fruity notes present with this coffee (the tasting notes suggest pineapple and melon - I&#39;m not sure I really pick out those at least in the first few cups I&#39;ve had so far). . Overall a very interesting, somewhat challenging coffee. I&#39;m certainly glad to have tried this one. I&#39;m also glad that PLOT appears to be a very high-level establishment, I could easily see this coffee being destroyed by a less capable roaster. I&#39;m sure I will be ordering from them again, it&#39;s nice to find another high quality roaster especially in London - I hope they achieve success. . Thinking of an album to pair with this coffee has been a bit of a struggle, I try and somehow link my album recommendation to the coffee somehow - through an idea/thought or through some indirect means. Given the coffee&#39;s qualities in the cup I feel a more avant-garde offering is appropriate - challenging but rewarding. I finally settled upon one of my favourite offerings in this style: Andrew Hill&#39;s Point Of Departure. . . This album was recorded by Rudy Van Gelder, like many of the great Blue Note records. Released in 1965 it features a blockbuster line-up that would challenge any album you care to mention in terms of prestige: Andrew Hill (piano), Kenny Dorham (trumpet), Eric Dolphy (alto sax and flute), Joe Henderson (tenor sax), Richard Davis (bass) and Tony Williams (drums). This is ilustrated by Reid Miles&#39; inimitable artwork where title, artist and supporting cast are given equal size fonts. While not the most creative or iconic Blue Note artwork it certainly still packs a punch. . The music on this cut is typical Andrew Hill - slightly chaotic, partly dense and partly sparse. The opening theme on &quot;Refuge&quot; is a twisting and turning affair that lets you are not in for a &quot;typical&quot; Blue Note hard-bop romp. As was the style for the earlier &quot;free&quot; recordings there is still a fair amount of structure to the composition rather than just a free-for-all -typically following a form of: a theme/phrase to open, an extended modal static section for soloing and then closing with a variation on the opening theme. The themes themselves, however, are looser and more angular than typcially found on bop records often having more dissonance, extended voicings and odd timings. . Of the soloists, as expected, Hill and Dolphy are in their element. The latter in particular producing, in my opinion, some of his best soloing - wild and on the edge of completely losing control yet still having a sense of swing. Dorham in contrast is not somebody who you would expect to see on a date like this, he is best known for his understated deeply melodic and lyrical style. He still brings that quality here but the magic of Hill&#39;s compositions are that this still fits - by dialing back the crazy at some parts and turning it up at others it allows all the musicians to find their voice. This is something that is difficult to do, especially on dates where there are a lot of &quot;star names&quot; vying for the limelight. If you have read my first blog post you&#39;ll know I&#39;m a big Joe Henderson fan, he is allowed to be looser and freerer here than he is on other records - but being surrounded by Hill and Dolphy he acts as a transition between the frenetic of these two and the soulful mastery of Dorham. As he always does showing his mastery as a side-man a fitting into any role you throw at him. . Perhaps the underrated star of this record that pulls the whole thing together is Tony Williams (credited as &quot;Anthony Williams&quot; as he was earlier in his career). During recording of this record he would have only been 19 years old (the other members being in their 30s-40s), which shows what a prodigious talent he was. Williams is probably best known for his later work in jazz-fusion settings where he devloped a very forceful driving drumming style which later influenced Billy Cobham and the likes. On Point Of Depature however he offers up a much more fluid loose style, while not a strong driving sound he controls the mood masterfully - the chemistry with Hill and Dolphy is fantastic having just recorded the equally seminal &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; under Dolphy&#39;s name only a month prior. . My choice track is the opening to side 2 on the vinyl recording: &quot;Spectrum&quot;. The playing and composition are incredible and there is a certain Monk-esque humour to the theme. Coming up to 60 years old this recording sounds like it could have come from any time period. While not the easiest start into the world of jazz it certainly rewards those that make an effort. If you are looking for comforting or easy the coffee and jazz on offer today will not satisfy you. However if you want to open yourself up to something a bit challenging, new and possibly exciting you could do a lot worse than give either of these a try! .",

            "title": "The Intangible Between and Round Hill Rimiro Natural",
            "content": "A bit of an experimental blog post today; yesterday (May 1st 2020) marked the release of the new record from Orrin Evans Captain Black Big Band on Smoke Sessions records: &quot;The Intangible Between&quot;. I&#39;m going to blog my reaction to hearing this album for the first time. If you are looking for a more detailed review this is not going to be it. . . The Captain Black Big Band project is quite interesting to me. Big bands have largely fallen out of favour, there aren&#39;t many bands out there making records. I assume it&#39;s a financially motivated thing: touring with 12 musicians is more expensive than with a trio - you can&#39;t charge four times as much on the door! It makes big band records such as this exciting. The first Captain Black album was released in 2011 and I believe they have 3 out previously before this one. I&#39;ve always been a fan, they tend to be quite a rambunctious group heading towards the &quot;freer&quot; side than your traditional big band. The influence of the Mingus big bands is clearly evident. Around the mid 2010s Orrin Evans joined the Smoke Sessions record label who have put out some of the best jazz of recent years in my opinion. I was a little dis-heartened to see Orrin had joined The Bad Plus, who I&#39;m indifferent towards, but glad to see he&#39;s still releasing music under his own name. As such I am excited to see what this album has in store. . My liquid accompaniment for these preceedings is a naturally processed Burundi called Rimiro, another coffee from the fine folks at the Round-Hill roastery. I normally favour &quot;clean&quot; tastes so I sometimes struggle with naturals that are too funky. Thankfully there is no issue of funk here, it is on the elegant end of the spectrum. Flavour wise in the filter I get a big hit of red-wine, the natural processing leading to the familiar &quot;boozy&quot; notes as they often do. It is fairly refined as a drinking experience with a lot of fruit and acidity in the cup. As an espresso you gain a big mouthfeel and tonnes of body, the red wine is still prominent but there&#39;s a candy-bubblegum sort of vibe that takes over - paired with the mouthfeel it reminds me of a milkshake! A very cool coffee indeed, I have found Burundis have really improved over the past few years. Now it&#39;s one of my favourite origins and often really impresses. Overall I think I marginally preferred the Claude but you cannot go wrong with either of these coffees. Hopefully this is a good omen for the jazz. . The album kicks off with &quot;Proclaim Liberty&quot;, opening with a fairly traditional brass arragement - quickly subsiding into the main theme led by bass and piano. The band makes use of its full ensemble with a lot of rich harmony but as with other Captain Black records when soloing many musicians drop out leaving the soloist space to express themselves. As he usually does Orrin plays with his choppy stacatto piano style. Towards the end of the piece the tempo raises and things get a little more out there, overall a positive start to the album. Listening I couldn&#39;t help but notice a certain similarity to some of the Frank Zappa jazzier offerings (such as &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; and &quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot;) in some of the melodies - no bad thing. . The second track &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot; again makes use of the number of brass instruments, big lush full harmony washes over you. As the name suggests this is a reworking of the gospel classic. The drumming brings a frenetic quality to the whole affair though. This is mirrored in the opening sax solo which has some cool angular lines. Orrin carries on the urgency with an athletic piano solo spanning the instruments range. The outside playing does not feel forced however, it always feels natural. Something that cannot be said for a lot of modern jazz players - it feels modern yet at the same time could have been released at any time. . &quot;A Time for Love&quot; is the third track, as a stark contrast to the raw energy of the previous number it&#39;s time to slow things down. The only word to describe the melody here is beautiful. Nobody is overplaying on this piece, with down-tempo numbers there is sometimes a tendency to throw too much technique at the tune - not the case here. The use of a fender rhodes mid-tune just fits the mood perfectly. This is a very accomplished take on a standard. . The previous tune is just the calm before the storm however as &quot;That Too&quot; starts with a powerful Mingus-esque melody full of attitude and swagger. Again I here some Zappa-isms in the arrangment. At this point in the album, approximately a quarter of the way through, you can tell that they really went for it on this album. This is not a safe album, they&#39;re taking risks and trying to really make a statement - so far it is working. . The next tune is instantly recognisable as &quot;Off Minor&quot; by Thelonious Monk. Orrin&#39;s playing has always reminded me a little of Monk - it&#39;s very rhythmic and choppy in contrast to many other players who play smooth flowing sort of styles. I tend to think covering Monk brings out a lot of joy in the musicians and gives them a chance to playful. That does not seem to be the modus-operandi here however - again they seem to want to make a point. So far this is the most free and outside of the tunes on this album. The tempo modulates up and down through the piece and there is some wild soloing throughout. Very cool! &quot;Into Dawn&quot; brings us back down to reality again, starting off with some much less challenging harmony. The arrangment feels largely similar to the Roy Hargrove original - of course the musicians here throwing the &quot;Captain Black&quot; spin on things. Given the recent (tragic) passing of Roy Hargrove this feels a particularly fitting tribute. . The extended take &quot;Tough Love&quot; begins with a poem - one doesn&#39;t have to look very hard to see the obvious Mingus influence here. The references to black-lives matter, school-shootings and general hate strike a mournful tone, the suggestion the poem suggests that letting in love, while challenging, could change everything. I don&#39;t want to try and unpick the deeper meaning here as I&#39;m unlikely to do this justice on a first listen. I think this will provide a challenging and thought-provoking quality to any future listening. . The last tune on the album is &quot;I&#39;m so Glad I Got to Know You&quot; - it doesn&#39;t take much to uncover the underlying theme of this piece. Evans penned this as a tribute to Lawrence Loâ Leathers who the jazz community also lost far too early. Starting with a contemplative solo piano intro it breaks into a more upbeat swinging big-band arragement - I presume illustrating the nature of loss. The tune ends with a chorus singing the tracks title - a very fitting and heartwarming end to the album. Overall this album has been a moving and sometimes challenging listen, but the quality is unmistakable. It is certainly worth hunting down through whatever medium you consume your music. I will be giving this another listen (or two) in the coming days. Walking the line between free and more traditional styles is tricky, especially as a big band, but this album shows Orrin knows how to do it. .",

            "title": "Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio and Round Hill Spring Claude",
            "content": "In this blog post I&#39;m going to write about 2 main themes: the first being contentious opinions. . I&#39;m just going to come out and say it: I don&#39;t like Oscar Peterson. I know admitting this will cause the jazz police to come over to my house and beat down my door, but it&#39;s true. I find his playing to rely on too many flashy tricks played at break-neck speed. The music, in my opinion, tends to suffer as a result. Don&#39;t get me wrong I can appreciate what he could do and of course he played with some amazing artists (Lester Young being one such example) - but he just ends up leaving me cold and so I never normally reach for one of his albums. I think in the jazz world we do get caught up in &quot;hero worship&quot; a bit too much, certain players get elevated to god status and can do no wrong. Miles Davis for example, the early stuff is obviously fantastic and he deserves all the praise he gets. But some of the later synthy-pop stuff? You&#39;d be hard pressed to argue some of that has much artistic merit - a player without his reputation would be crucified for it. . On the coffee side I also have a rather contentious opinion: I tend to not be overly impressed with Colombian origins. For me there are (obviously) some great ones but a large number of the coffees strike me as rather &quot;meh&quot;. Also certain areas in Colombia are renowned for their big body, nutty sort of flavour notes - these are not what I favour at all. I look for delicate florals and fruit notes first and foremost. As such it is rare I will order a bag of a Colombian origin given the choice. . This leads me onto the second theme of the day: pleasant surpirses (when they really shouldn&#39;t be surprising at all). . In 1954 Lester Young stepped into the studio with Oscar Peterson (and others) to record the album: &quot;Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio&quot;. A fun fact about this recording: it featured the Oscar Peterson Quartet rather than the trio as the name would suggest. Originally released as 3 seperate albums but has since been combined into 1 volume. Given my relationship with Oscar Peterson I did not listen to this album for years, despite Lester Young being one of my all time favourite artists - more fool me, since the album is fantastic from start to finish. . Lester Young was a curious fellow, he had a rather natty dress sense (with a particular perchant for pork-pie hats). While some of his contemporaries relied on technique and muscling their way through the changes, Lester took a much more laid back approach, sitting right in the pocket and playing relatively few notes with a more lyrical style. This was perfectly exemplified on his recordings with Billie Holiday, their styles blending perfectly. This laid back sax vibe was a reflection of his persona too, very laid back and &quot;cool&quot; - he was known for creating much of the jazz &quot;lingo&quot; of the time which is still being used today (including the term &quot;hipster&quot;). His friends call him &quot;Prez&quot; or &quot;the president&quot;. . The record itself poses an interesting counterpoint: Oscar wanting to up the tempo and play fancy lines while Lester wanting to sit in the pocket. The result is each player compromises - Lester plays some of his fastest most intricate lines on this record and Oscar dials back. It all just works, I would love to have sat in on the session I could have easily seen this going off the rails one way or the other. . We shouldn&#39;t just focus on the 2 named artists however, the &quot;backing&quot; band is also fantastic (and could have lead other dates) featuring Ray Brown on bass, JC Hoard on drums and Barney Kessell on guitar. As a guitarist Barney is one of my favourites, he was very clearly in the Charlie Christian school of jazz guitar (which is no bad thing). On this record he plays some great solos for example on &quot;Tea for Two&quot;. Barney also had one of the best guitar tones I ever heard with his Charlie-Christian pickuped guitars and you can tell he is using one here. . The album itself is almost entirely made up of standards from &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;, &quot;There Will Never be Another You&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot;. On modern reissues there is also a cool outtake &quot;(It Takes) Two to Tango&quot; which features Lester singing (as far as I&#39;m aware the only recorded track of him doing so). If I had to pick one tune to exemplify this recording though I would pick &quot;Just You, Just Me&quot;: Focussing now on this week&#39;s coffee; as you may have guessed it is a Colombian origin from La Vega in Tarqui, Huila. The coffee in question is roasted by Round Hill Roastery ( https://roundhillroastery.com/ ) and is their &quot;Spring Claude&quot; offering. Every season (I beleive) the folks at Round Hill release a &quot;special&quot; coffee in special packages under the &quot;Claude&quot; name. Claude being a cat: You can follow Claude&#39;s exploits on his instagram: https://www.instagram.com/monsieur_claude . As always I opt for the filter roast, I prefer the less developed roasts even for espresso and given a choice I will opt for the filter roast even if it is to be used as an espresso. This coffee is roasted particularly light, I don&#39;t have an agtron/tonino (yet) to measure this however . As a filter you&#39;re not greeted with a very pungent aroma, there are gentle berry type smells but they&#39;re quite mellow. On first sip however you get smacked round the face with sweetness. This is one of the sweetest coffees I&#39;ve had in a while, it has a candy-floss or sugar-syrup vibe. There is also a hit of red berry type flavours, I would describe as a raspberry. It is very easy to drink, a cup can disappear before you&#39;ve even noticed - which is always a good sign. There is some balancing acidity to the sweetness but predominently it is all about the candy. . Being a lighter roast pulling an espresso can be a bit of an issue. With coffees such as these I recommend pulling shots slighltly longer (around 2.25-2.75:1 sort of range) at a higher temperature than normal and quickly! However this coffee is fairly forgiving, it is not particularly acidic so I didn&#39;t end up with any super-sour shots. When dialed in the sugary goodness comes through, however you also have a reasonable amount of body coming through. It really gives off a syrupy vibe. The raspberry note is still there too. . I enjoyed this coffee a lot, more than I expected to given the origin. . However I should really not be surprised by my enjoyment from either the album or the coffee. Lester Young constantly provides inspiration and I find Round Hill one of the most consistently great roasters in the UK. It goes to show that sometimes preconceptions can get in the way. .",

            "title": "Inner Urge - Joe Henderson and Assembly Los Urena",
            "content": "In my bleary-eyed haze of an early morning I paw at the laptop trying to get some music to play. Before my morning coffee my creativity levels are low; I reach for an old favourite: âInner Urgeâ by Joe Henderson. This album holds a special place in my heart, it is perhaps the most important album in my jazz appreciation. It was the album that converted my thinking from: âthis jazz stuff is quite coolâ to a full-blown obsession. Iâm not one to believe in fate or superstition but this album was recorded on my birthday (albeit many years before I was born) â which is kind of a neat coincidence. . . It starts with the title track; McCoy Tynerâs powerful opening chord stab sets the tone for the rest of the album. A dark and brooding, contemplative album throughout, all the time walking the fine line between sophisticated bop and chaotic free jazz â Joe with his albums from the mid-60s seamlessly blended these ideas like no one else. As the music is playing I grab a bag of coffee off the shelf, todayâs offering is a Costa Rican from the folks at Assembly Coffee ( https://assemblycoffee.co.uk/ ). The coffee is called Los Urena and is a honey processed typica from the Tarrazu region. Opening the bag (some of the nicest packaging in the business for my money), Iâm greeted with a warming floral honey aroma. I doubt that this is going to be a big âpunch in the faceâ sort of flavour bomb of a coffee, it is more a refined easy drinking elegance. I move onto preparing the beans. . . The second track is now playing: &quot;Isotope&quot;. This is perhaps my favourite track on the album â it has a joyful playfulness yet angular ugliness to it. When I first heard this, Iâd not heard anything like it â little did I know it was penned as a tribute to Thelonious Monk who I got (really) into many years later. Listening back now the Monk-isms are unmistakable an absolute joy to listen to. As the track ends I finish preparing the filter coffee. Giving the cup a cursory sniff, I get mostly the same notes as from the beans â a sweet rich honey and some light florals. I wait a little for the cup to cool down and let the Latin influence of âEl Barrioâ cries out, Joeâs improvisation is incredible on this track. Others from the era might have played faster or had a more sophisticated sense of harmony but for my money Joe is the best improviser (possibly ever) â his lines are never neat or fall nicely under the fingers, itâs as though there is zero resistance between mind and the instrument. The first sip of coffee acts like a big warm comforting liquid hug. This coffee will never go down as one of the most complex cups, but it is sophisticated. The thing that often strikes me about Assembly roasts is they tend to be very clean (which is a quality I always look for in a coffee) â these honey processed Americans can often get a bit âblurryâ tasting but not here, everything is refined and elegant. I am thoroughly enjoying this cup. . Through my years of drinking specialty I usually find that during each year there is one origin that is particularly spectacular, I can only assume that it is down to particular weather patterns in each region â much like certain wine vintages are so sort after. This year it seems like it is going to be Tarrazu Costa Ricans, this is the 2nd this year that has been great. . Finishing up the cup and the next tune begins, a change of pace and a beautiful ballad called âYou Know I Careâ penned by Duke Pearson. I often think ballads are underappreciated, playing over ballads requires just as much skill as blowing over crazy bop changes. Here Joe shows his lyricism, you can feel every single note and phrase. Not content with playing it straight he throws in a few more angular phrases but they never feel out of place. Itâs now time to test how this coffee behaves as an espresso. This coffee is intended to be used as a filter I believe; it is a light but not super-light roast. Being a honey processed American it is quite easy to extract and fairly forgiving. The espresso has some body to it but is not syrup monster like a darker roast would be. Like the filter it is not a flavour bomb but refined and clear, the florals pop a bit more and there is a bit of fruity acidity coming through overall fairly balanced. The flavour notes from Assembly say âMolasses, Blood Orange, Mellowâ â I donât get the blood orange too strongly but donât disagree with their assessment. . With the clean coffee aftertaste lingering for a few moments the final track is playing: a Cole Porter classic: âNight and Dayâ. This is not your typical take on the standard though, an up-tempo fire-breathing hard-bop romp through the changes. As the music fades and Iâm suitably caffeinated I finally feel ready for the day ahead. .",

The specialty coffee business is a difficult one to navigate, I do not feel right in slating any roaster/producer. Coffee choice is personal and just because I do not bond with a coffee doesnât mean it is âbadâ.

I have no affiliations or monetary interests in any coffee business nor am I paid to review or feature coffees â this is merely a passion project. . I have been an avid jazz fan for a long time and listen to pretty much every type of jazz from the earliest swing through to the latest releases. I want to make jazz more accessible so I will shy away from highly technical analyses (although those are interesting too) â hopefully making it fun and providing an easy introduction to the genre! .
