            "title": "Relaxin at Camarillo and La Esmeralada Special Gesha",
            "content": "This week we have a very special coffee featured on the blog. The coffee was roasted by Denmark&#39;s Coffee Collective - this is reason to celebrate in itself since they are one of the greatest coffee roasters out there. But what really makes this coffee special is it is a Gesha cultivar from Hacienda La Esmeralda in Boquete, Panama. . In some sense this is the &quot;Gesha that launched a thousand Geshas&quot; - as you may recall from prior blog posts: the Gesha cultivar was just an obscure cultivar until the &quot;best of Panama&quot; competition in 2005 whereby a Gesha grown by the Peterson family at Hacienda La Esmeralda shattered the competition and achieved record prices for green coffee. Through the rest of the 2000s and 2010s Gesha became the &quot;in&quot; cultivar and reached unprecedented demand, leading to ever climbing prices. Without Hacienda La Esmeralda we may have never witnessed the &quot;Gesha boom&quot;. . This particular coffee was grown in the &quot;Mario 5&quot; lot on the farm and the cherries were allowed to fully ripen to a deep red colour before being picked. Only a few of the lots grown get labeled with &quot;Esmeralda Special&quot; status - and this is one of them. So it is indeed a &quot;best of the best&quot; sort of coffee. After picking the coffee undergoes a fully washed process, the farm also has lots that undergo other processing methods. For me, however, washed is king. Especially with a special coffee like this: I want to taste the coffee/terroir not the process! . As you would expect a coffee like this does not come cheap, and as a result the bag weight is only 120g. Because of this I decided not to play around with espresso with this one, the thought of having a &quot;sink job&quot; shot is too painful. So this week we only have filter coffee on the blog, normal espresso service will presume next week. . Diving into the coffee itself: the dry aroma gives off subtle floral notes. This is what we have come to expect from Gesha, they tend to be understated but complex. There are also the characteristic bergamot notes there too, in Gesha that has undergone more &quot;exotic&quot; processing methods often miss this note so it&#39;s nice to see it so prevalent here. . Moving onto what&#39;s important: the cup itself. The first thing that stands out is how clean the cup is. There is an insane amount of clarity in the brew. Despite the rather delicate nose on the dry aroma the cup itself is fairly intense for a Gesha. There is a high level of sweetness in the cup that I would describe as being quite &quot;sticky&quot; like a particularly ripe peach. Alongside, of course, comes the florals we come to expect. It is a very perfumed cup that evolves and changes as the cup cools. The bergamot note comes through in the finish and lingers on through the aftertaste. I would describe the length of the aftertaste as being medium - not super long, but not shortlived either. You can also miss the aftertaste all together because the cup is so clean. . This was a coffee I was really looking forward to so it is great that it lived up to my internal hype. Of course it is not an &quot;everyday&quot; sort of coffee but a special &quot;once in a while&quot; experience. A big thanks to Coffee Collective for making this coffee available and doing such a good job roasting. It is often difficult for &quot;the general public&quot; to get hold of coffees such as these as they often end up being used for barista competitions and the like. . Alongside this rather special coffee we are heading back to 1979 and Joe Henderson&#39;s &quot;Relaxin at Camarillo&quot;. . . The first thing to note about the album is the fantastic cover art - the silhouette of Joe smoking, wearing his trademark glasses against the vivid red background is certainly one of the coolest and most iconic album covers of the era. At least for my money. Long time readers of the blog will know that Joe Henderson is a firm JazzCoffeeStuff favourite and he often appears on the blog. &quot;Relaxin at Camarillo&quot; is one of his more &quot;obscure&quot; recordings - he&#39;s much better known for his standout Blue Note recordings or even his Milestone or Verve releases later in his career. &quot;Relaxin at Camarillo&quot; appears on the Contemporary label - Joe&#39;s only release on this label. What makes this album particularly noteworthy however is the addition of Chick Corea on piano (who also appears on another &quot;obscure&quot; Henderson recording &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;). . Of course Chick himself needs no introduction, being a true jazz legend in his own right. On &quot;Relaxin at Camarillo&quot; he eschews the electric keyboards and synths in favour of an acoustic piano. This gives the album an &quot;organic&quot; feel to it, something that Joe seemed to favour as his records rarely feature electric instruments. It is always a pleasure to hear Chick playing acoustic, on electric instruments he tends to play very technically while acoustically we get to really appreciate his phrasing. . The record consists of 2 recording dates, Chick (and obviously Joe) appear on both dates which bass and drum duties are split between: Richard Davis and Tony Dumas (on bass) and Peter Erskine and Tony Williams (on drums). While there is not a huge difference in bass styles (although you can notice the difference) the two drummers have very different approaches which adds to the albums intrigue. Williams certainly swings harder and is a much &quot;louder&quot; drummer wheras Erskine is much more restrained. . Somewhat unusually Chick takes writing credit for 2 out of the 5 tracks on the album with Joe taking just 1 of 5 (the remaining being comprised of a standard and the Charlie Parker track from which the album gets its name). Joe clearly buying into the mantra: &quot;hire good people, then get out of their way&quot;. . With a relatively short track listing it is quite hard to pick out &quot;choice tracks&quot; since every one of them is worthy of a listen. The album opens with the Henderson penned &quot;Y Todavia La Quiero&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) which has all the hallmarks of a Henderson composition. A modern jazz vibe combined with an afro-cuban rhythm. This gives Joe a chance to show off his soloing prowess as he pushes and pulls the meter with ease as he darts from the lowest to the highest register of his horn. . Another highlight is the Chick Corea penned &quot;Crimson Lake&quot; (above). This piece walks the line between hard-bop and free-jazz that Joe does so well, it gives him ample opportunity to pull out his trill and ghost note trickery while still remaining somewhat &quot;inside&quot; with his soloing. The drumming from Tony Williams is really a standout here too, he is a bundle of energy and manages to push Joe to play more and more &quot;outside&quot; before switching to an audacious swing for Chick&#39;s bop-inspired solo. . Lastly the album closes with &quot;Relaxin at Camarillo&quot; (below) - a take on the Charlie Parker piece of the same name. Of course Joe has reworked the tune to impart his character to it. While the original has a swinging nature to the main theme, Joe&#39;s take has a much more syncopated feel. And while Parker punctuates his slippery be-bop lines with blues like phrasing - Joe&#39;s solo is firmly in hard-bop territory and at times strays very much outside before finding his way back home. It is a really cool and interesting take on the original and so it is easy to see why the album was named after the piece. . While &quot;Relaxin at Camarillo&quot; might not be the first on the list of Joe Henderson recordings to check out, it is certainly worth hunting down if you are a fan of either Henderson or Corea. .",

            "content": "For our coffee this week we are back to Woolwich&#39;s finest: Plot Coffee Roasters and another one of their &quot;Icon Series&quot; coffees. As you may recall these represent some of the most rare and interesting coffees available. . This time the coffee is called: Milenio Carbonic Maceration Enrique Navarro Caravajal - this is a bit of a mouthful so let&#39;s break down the name bit by bit. Firstly &quot;Milenio&quot; represents the coffee cultivar, you would be forgiven for not having heard of this cultivar before since it is fairly rare. This cultivar is also known as H10 and it is a hybrid (F1) cultivar that is a cross between TS296 and Rume Sudan. Hybrid cultivars are likely to become more and more prevalent as disease, pests and climate change continue to challenge coffee production. By hybridizing very distant ancestors we are able to produce cultivars that are high yielding, resistant to disease, resistant to pests, resistant to changing weather patterns yet still retaining the cup qualities we desire. . The next part of the name &quot;carbonic maceration&quot; refers to the processing methodology. This is an idea which originated in wine making but we are seeing more and more in coffee processing. Coffee cherries are place in a sealed tank with a 1-way valve at the top. Carbon dioxide is forced into the tank from the bottom - since this is heavier than oxygen this pushes oxygen out of the 1 way valve and so a very controlled anaerobic environment is created. This allows fermentation to occur in a very predictable way. . The last part of the name: &quot;Enrique Navarro Carvajal&quot; represents the producers name. He owns a farm Hacienda Santa Anita located in West Valley, Costa Rica. The farm is extremely focussed on sustainability and is certified carbon neutral. 85% of all electrical consumption for the farm comes from solar panels. . Onto the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I get a strong &quot;funk&quot; note, almost to the point of being unpleasant. I&#39;m not a big &quot;funky coffee&quot; guy and I tend to favour cleaner more refined cups so this was a bit of a shock. Alongside the funk I get notes of bruised blueberries and fudge. . As a filter the funk is still noticable but is not the &quot;hit in the face&quot; I got when first opening the bag. The funkiness comes in the form of bruised blueberries to my palate, a slightly boozy sherry note too but this quickly gives way to a lot of sweetness which I consider to be a sort of fudge-caramel in nature. There is some acidity there but compared to most coffees on this blog I would describe it as fairly muted, the emphasis is more on the sweetness. The body is interesting, in the opening it feels fairly thin but it grows on you and the aftertaste has a decent body to it which helps it linger. . As an espresso I found this one fairly easy to dial in, although I did need to set my grinder to be very fine - potentially some may struggle to grind fine enough here. I ultimately settled on a fairly standard: 1:2.5 ratio in 22s which has become my &quot;normal&quot; shot recipe with my new grinder. In the filter this coffee was a bit wild and funky, but as an espresso these flavours blend together a bit better and you&#39;re left with quite a powerful and direct shot with flavours of blueberry, sherry and caramel. In the filter this coffee was on the verge of too funky for me, but it makes for a fantastic (and very drinkable) espresso shot. . It goes without saying but Plot have come up with another fun and interesting coffee for their Icon series - we have 1 more left in the year so will be eagerly awaiting what might be in store. . For our iconic jazz this week we&#39;re heading deep into fusion territory with Mahavishnu Orchestra and their 1973 release &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; . . Fusion still remains somewhat of a contentious issue with some jazz fans, many traditionalists refusing to even consider it &quot;jazz&quot;. I don&#39;t get involved in the &quot;where jazz ends&quot; discussions as they tend to be counter-productive - the influence of fusion, however, is undeniable. Through the 1970s and 1980s many jazz artists started to ditch their acoustic instruments in favour of electric and began taking more influence from the classic rock sounds that were popular at the time. As with any movement there were plenty of bad fusion acts around, but one of the forefathers and most popular acts (to this day) were Mahavishnu Orchestra. . Mahavishnu Orchestra was started by English guitarist John McLaughlin in 1971. Over the years the band underwent many changes in personnel, but the original line-up (who feature on &quot;Birds of Fire&quot;) consists of: . John McLaughlin - Electric Guitar | Jerry Goodman - Electric Violin | Rick Laird - Bass Guitar | Jan Hammer - Keyboards/Synth | Billy Cobham - Drums | . At the time these musicians were relatively unknown (although at this point McLaughlin had worked with Miles) but through Mahavishnu Orchestra they had a major impact on both jazz and music more widely. Initially all compositions came from John McLaughlin who was becoming increasingly inspired by Indian spirituality (and later went on to record with Indian musician Shakti). This was combined with a hard hitting rock ethos and their live shows were known for being some of the loudest and most energetic performances around. One of the first tours for Mahavishnu Orchestra came supporting Frank Zappa&#39;s group, at the time Frank was playing fairly refined music to &quot;college educated&quot; audiences. Reportedly after experiencing Mahavishnu Orchestra live he decided to change direction, sacked his current band and hired a whole new band. He wanted to &quot;blow audiences away&quot; as Mahavishnu did. . Some fusion now suffers from &quot;curse of the 1980s production&quot; whereby the use of highly processed electric instruments, recording and mixing styles now sound very dated. This is not the case with Mahavishnu Orchestra (at least the early records) - this is definitely a positive for today&#39;s listener. To better understand what Mahavishnu Orchestra are all about it&#39;s easiest to just dive into some tunes. The title-track album opener &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) is one of the bands signature tunes and encapsulates the band&#39;s sound. It starts off with some almost meditative chords from McLaughlin in 9/8, combined with a simple yet grounding bass-line from Laird. The main theme then kicks in featuring some very loud, brash and outside playing with an almost punk-rock attitude. Some very high octane solos follow as Cobham increases the energy with his powerful yet sophisticated drumming. . Another highlight is the tune &quot;Celestial Terrestrial Commuters&quot; (above) where the odd time signatures really get going - the tune being based around a groove in 19/16. Cobham manages to keep things swinging despite the complicated time signature and break-neck speed - it is perhaps the piece which really shows off Cobham&#39;s playing best on the album. Another highlight is the section where McLaughlin and Goodman trade bars in a classic &quot;call and response&quot; style - but as you would expect this isn&#39;t your typical be-bop piece. . It is important to note that although Mahavishnu Orchestra is all about high octane and powerful playing they can also play down-tempo too. This is most apparent on the piece &quot;Thousand Island Park&quot; (below) where the band decide to ditch the distortion and synths. Anybody familiar with McLaughlin&#39;s back catalogue will know from records like &quot;Friday Night In San Francisco&quot; and the Shakti records that John is a monster acoustic player so it is nice to hear this here. It procides a great contrast to the rest of the album and is just an all round beautiful composition that is easy to forget about given the craziness of the rest of the record. . As with all of my &quot;Icon Series&quot; posts: &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; is essential listening for any jazz fan. Even if you&#39;re not the biggest &quot;fusion&quot; person around there is plenty to enjoy on this album. If you&#39;re relatively new to jazz as a whole you might have the impression that jazz is &quot;relaxing background music&quot; - this album proves that it need not be. .",

            "title": "Fletcher Moss Park and da Matteo",
            "content": "This week we take a (rather belated) look at the October offering from my KaffeBox subscription. Due to a bumper haul of &quot;exotic&quot; coffees lately I put these coffees on ice (literally - in the freezer) for a couple of weeks. . This time the featured roaster is da Matteo, located in Gothenburg, Sweden. This is a completely new roaster to me and one I don&#39;t know much about. The first thing that I notice on their understated packaging is that they offer 2 distinct set of taste (and aroma) notes depending on whether you use soft or hard water. This is a first for me and I think I approve. Water makes such a big difference to the flavour experience it makes sense to have alternative notes. On the flip side however, just the overall &quot;hardness&quot; of the water is not necessarily a good estimator for how the water will work for coffee. It is nice to see a roaster try and deal with the water problem though, so brownie points to da Matteo on this. . As you may recall in my KaffeBox subscription I get 2 bags of 125g each, so I tend to dedicate one to filter and one to espresso for testing. In this case I made my selection based on origin: I tend to find Kenyan coffees more enjoyable in a filter setting. . The Kenyan in question is called Murang&#39;a AA, as you would expect it is a washed coffee and it comprises of SL28, SL34, Ruiru, Batian and K7 cultivars. On the nose the dry aroma gives me the familiar thwack of blackcurrant we all love about Kenyan coffee. Alongside this is a sort of candy or sugary sweetness. As a filter my instant reaction is one of shock, this coffee has an extremely high flavour intensity. If you like your coffees to beat you round the head with flavour this is one for you. The overarching flavour is of course the blackcurrant and blackberry you would expect. But alongside are a lot of florals, I would describe them as more violet and lavender floral than say a jasmine. The cup is extremely clean which seems to amplify the intensity of flavour. In terms of body I&#39;d describe it as medium to low, it&#39;s not water-y thin but nor is it a chewy cup. This coffee really impressed me and for my money one of the best KaffeBox offerings so far this year. . On the espresso side of things we have a natural Colombian: Manos Juntas, consisting of Castillo, Colombia and F6 cultivars. On the nose the dry aroma gives off notes of strawberry and jasmine like florals. I found dialing in this espresso relatively easy and I ended up settling on a rather typical (for my set-up) 1:2.5 in about 22s. Again on first sip the things I note down are &quot;clean cup&quot; and &quot;flavour intensity&quot; - maybe this is somewhat of a &quot;house style&quot; for da Matteo? In terms of flavour profile I get more tropical fruits: papaya, mango and melon coming through along with the strawberry note from the nose. Alongside is an almost custard-y vibe in both flavour and mouthfeel. . Another solid pair of coffees from KaffeBox in this instalment - possibly my favourite so far. There may have been more &quot;complex&quot; cups in the past but the flavour intensity here is something special. As a result da Matteo is certainly on my radar and one I&#39;ll keep an eye out for. . On the jazz side this week we take a trip back nearly 10 years to a recording from Matthew Halsall and &quot;Fletcher Moss Park&quot;. . . Matthew Halsall is an English trumpet player based out of Manchester. He released his first album in 2008 and (at time of writing) has 8 albums to his name. His style certainly falls into the &quot;spiritual&quot; side of modal jazz with Alice Coltrane being the most clear influence on his work. At times you can also hear shades of Miles Davis modal period in his playing and especially his phrasing. Alongside these jazz influences he has also taken influence from hip hop and electronic dance music - this is not so much in &quot;sound&quot; (he sticks to acoustic instruments in his arrangements almost entirely) but in vibe. A Matthew Halsall album tends to have an almost meditative feel to it. This experience is doubled if you ever get to see him live. He is not much of a &quot;show man&quot; there is very little in the way of crowd engagement, but he has the ability to transport the audience to a different place. There are very few acts around today who do the whole spiritual jazz thing as well as Halsall. . &quot;Fletcher Moss Park&quot; marks the fourth record in the Halsall back catalogue and for me it is the first where his sound fully developed. On the previous albums he was at perhaps 90%, but everything just fell into place with &quot;Fletcher Moss Park&quot; (and subsequent). Each track on the album has a certain &quot;Halsall quality&quot; that is unmistakable, you can hear his influences come through but at the same time his own personality and vision remains clear. . As with all spiritual jazz &quot;Fletcher Moss Park&quot; is less about specific details of the music and more about a vibe. The name of the album and the artwork gives a good impression of what to expect: I get the impression of a contemplative walk through the woodland while listening to the album. . With an album like this it is difficult to pin-point individual tracks as &quot;highlights&quot; since this album is best appreciated from start to finish. The album opener &quot;Cherry Blossom&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) is one of the high points of the album and does a good job setting the scene. The Miles influence on Halsall&#39;s playing is particularly apparent here as he plays some tasty sparse modal lines. &quot;Mary Emma Louise&quot; (above) is another track that sticks out for being the most &quot;uptempo&quot; number on the album and probably the closest thing to a swing you&#39;ll hear on the album. The penultimate track on the album &quot;The Sun in September&quot; (below) is another track worth highlighting for being one of the more ambitious tracks on the record. This track almost provides the blueprint for some of his later works - it shows great maturity for a band leader to sit out for the majority of a track. Halsall manages to say a lot without actually playing much and that is a real skill. . If Matthew Halsall is a new name to you I would definitely recommend checking him out, and &quot;Fletcher Moss Park&quot; is a good place to start. I&#39;m a big fan of his music and live performances and you can&#39;t really go wrong with any of his albums/gigs. Be sure to also check out other artists on his &quot;Gondwana Records&quot; record label if you enjoy what you hear also. .",

            "title": "Life To Everything and El Zafiro Wush Wush",
            "content": "This week our featured coffee comes from Assembly Coffee Roasters located in Brixton, London. It&#39;s been a while since Assembly has featured on this blog (not for any particular reason) so it is a welcome return. I find Assembly to be one of the best and most consistent roasters in the UK so I&#39;m sure this coffee will be a good one. . The coffee in question comes from their &quot;Limited Edition&quot; series of coffees. As the name suggests these are not your &quot;everyday&quot; coffees but something a bit more special. Assembly don&#39;t seem to have a particular release schedule for these and they turn up as/when something interesting becomes available, which is probably a better way to do it than &quot;committing&quot; to finding top quality coffee every month/whatever. Of course being limited edition this coffee costs more than the &quot;regular&quot; Assembly offerings but the pricing is not in the stratosphere. . As you have probably summised from the title of this blog post, this week we have another Wush Wush cultivar. I guess Wush Wush is like busses: you wait all year and then 2 arrive at once. As we noted last week, Wush Wush is &quot;kinda&quot; like Gesha in a way: its origins are in Ethiopia and it has since been exported to (mainly) the Americas. As with last weeks example this example comes from Colombia. . The coffee comes from the El Zafiro farm owned by Don Oscar located in Cauca, South Western Colombia. If we consider Hacienda La Esmeralda the &quot;original&quot; Gesha farm in some sense we could consider this farm the &quot;original&quot; Wush Wush farm, as I believe they offered the first Wush Wush available to the wider market. This initial sale actually became Assembly&#39;s first ever &quot;Limited Edition&quot; coffee. . This weeks coffee has undergone a washed process. This is my favourite type of processing for coffees as it allows the terroir to come through most clearly (in my opinion). . Let&#39;s dive right into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I get hit with a hit of sugary sweetness along with a heady floral bouquet. It is quite punchy on the nose compared to what one might expect from a &quot;floral&quot; focussed coffee. In terms of the type of florals I would describe them as the stickier elderflower, honeysuckle types as opposed to say a jasmine or lavendar. . Moving into the filter the sweetness comes through again. It is what I&#39;d describe as a candy sweetness or sugar-syrup even. The sweetness level of this coffee is very high but it is not cloying. The main flavour notes I get are again the honeysuckle and elderflower type florals. If you have ever had a &quot;fancy&quot; cake or pattiserie with candied flowers on it, that is the sort of vibe I get. Beneath this I get the stonefruit quality of a peach or apricot. The cup is very complex and it takes you on a journey as it cools, I found it most enjoyable once left to cool for a little while so the florals can speak. It is also a very &quot;clean&quot; cup and the flavour separation is very good, a &quot;downside&quot; of this is that it perhaps lacks a little body/mouthfeel compared to others. . As an espresso I found this a particularly easy one to dial in, it benefits from being pulled a bit longer in the 1:2.5-2.75 range. Going shorter than this led to a more intense cup but I found it harder to appreciate the complexity. In terms of flavour notes the stonefruits come more to the front along with the sugary hit. This makes for a very sweet shot of espresso with essentially no bitterness, so if this is something you crave in a shot it&#39;s a good coffee for you. Again owing to the washed processing and the act of pulling the shot a bit longer the body/mouthfeel do suffer as a result. . As I expected another knock-out coffee from Assembly. I don&#39;t really like to do comparative tastings between coffees but given we have 2 Wush Wush cultivars back to back: I feel this one is more &quot;me&quot;, the washed processing and cleanliness of the cup really speak to me. In terms of complexity the previous Plot Icon offering I&#39;d say is more complex and certainly offers more in the way of mouthfeel and texture. Both share the &quot;sweet but floral&quot; flavour profile of the Wush Wush. . For the jazz this week we are heading back to 2015 and the jazz trio Phronesis with their &quot;Life To Everything&quot; record. . . Phronesis were founded in 2005 by Danish bass player Jasper Høiby, originally with Magnus Hjorth on piano and Anton Eger on drums. In 2009 Magnus was replaced by Ivo Neame, at which point the band remained unchanged until 2020 when the band announced they were taking an &quot;extended break&quot; to allow each member to work on individual projects. . It is safe to say that Phronesis take a huge inspiration from Esbjörn Svensson Trio (EST) - though this could be said of just about any jazz trio from the 2000s onwards. Many reviews of the band start by making the comparison between the bands, but I feel it is only superficially true. While there are some similarities in their arrangements there is a totally different vibe to the bands - EST compositions tend to be more contemplative and meditative while Phronesis compositions are much more firey and energetic in approach. The energy and attitude of the music from Phronesis directly lends itself to live performances. For my money they were/are one of the best live acts around. By controlling the tempo and intensity they are the masters at working the crowd energy to their advantage and you leave one of their gigs with a sense of excitement that one might expect from a stadium rock concert. Jasper&#39;s stage patter also helps in that regard, while Phronesis are on hiatus he could quite easily make a living as a stand-up comedian also. It&#39;s quite rare to find jazz musicians who also have the charisma to work a crowd while the music stops. . The live performance prowess of the band is perhaps the reason why they opted to record &quot;Life To Everything&quot; live (at the Cockpit, London) - in someways a follow up to their &quot;Alive&quot; live recording a few years prior. As much as I love their studio recordings &quot;Life To Everything&quot; is one I find myself continually coming back to, of course it is impossible to capture all the energy of a live gig on record - but it does a damn good job. Live albums often have the issue of poor sound quality or mixing, but thankfully that is not the case here and you could easily be forgiven for not even noticing it is a live recording (aside from the occassional crowd cheering/applause). . The album gives each band member their chance to shine: Høiby gets ample opportunity to flex his bass chops playing some of the most intricate bass lines at break-neck speeds without dropping a beat and still managing to groove. Eger gets a chance to play all the complex fills he can muster at peak intensity and push/pull the tempo of the music at will. With such energy going on around him Neame has to play the &quot;straight man&quot; to hold the whole thing together, often hanging back to allow the others to shine. It is easy to overlook some of the delightful chord voicings he&#39;s playing amongst the chaos. And it goes without saying that the band is completely tight throughout, you can tell that they have played together for a long time and are totally comfortable with each other. . Some of my choice picks on the album include the opener &quot;Urban Control&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) - which has become a bit of a &quot;signature&quot; tune for the band. It starts around a cool, complicated but grooving bassline by Høiby that quickly undergoes a metamorphosis via changes in time-signature and tempo and some very singable melodies from Neame&#39;s piano. Another highlight for me is &quot;Herne Hill&quot; (above) which quickly takes on a bossa-nova and latin feeling but still retains the Phronesis DNA. Again the time signatures and tempos remain fluid throughout. The closing track &quot;Dr Black&quot; (below) features a melody somewhat reminiscent of a Brian Blade and the Fellowship Band tune before it turns very-Phronesis and the soloists get a chance to really show off their chops. . While &quot;Life To Everything&quot; cannot capture all of the energy of a Phronesis gig it does act as a good &quot;2nd best&quot;. While I&#39;m looking forward to hearing some of the individual projects - I hope that Phronesis will be back, even for the odd gig at some point in the future. .",

            "title": "Virtuoso and Icon 10",
            "content": "This week we have another &quot;Icon Series&quot; coffee from Plot Coffee Roasting in Woolwich, London. As you may recall the Icon series represents some of the more sort after and rare coffees available, and as part of the 10th installment in this series we have another special coffee. . As with many of the Icon coffees its the cultivar that makes this coffee unique: in this case we have a &quot;Wush Wush&quot; cultivar. You can think of Wush Wush as the precocious younger brother to the Gesha cultivar. Like Gesha it has its origins in Ethiopia but has since been exported to other areas, with most (that I&#39;ve seen at least) being grown in Colombia. Also like Gesha, Wush Wush is low yielding and quite difficult to grow - but the cup profile makes up for this. At date of writing the Wush Wush cultivars haven&#39;t quite gained the popularity of Gesha, and while not &quot;cheap&quot; they typically don&#39;t reach quite the stratospheric prices of the most prized Gesha coffees. . In addition to cultivar this coffee is interesting for its processing which is described as a &quot;Honey, Carbonic Maceration&quot;. The fruits are picked and fermented for 24 hours before being pulped and paced in a carbonic maceration tank to (anaerobically) ferment for another 24 hours. The coffee is then dried for a total of 20 days split between a drying structure and a poly-tunnel until the desired humidity levels are reached. . But all of this is moot unless the resulting coffee tastes great, so let&#39;s dive into it. On the dry aroma the first thing I note is &quot;sweet&quot;, upon opening the bag you can tell this one will be a very sweet one. I would describe the sweetness as being like a honey or quite a dark caramel type sweetness. Alongside there are some fruity notes but they&#39;re hard to pick out due to the honey being dominant. I also pick up some florality but again it&#39;s somewhat masked. . As usual moving onto the filter cup: the sweetness I picked up on the nose is instantly noticable here. This is a very sweet cup indeed. Whereas a Gesha might lean more onto floral notes the Wush Wush is known for leaning more into sweetness. The fruity notes on the nose become clearer in the cup and I would desribe them as being like a pommegranate or sharp citrus. This is not a highly acidic cup but there is enough there to cut the sweetness. As the cup cools the cup becomes more complex and some of the floral notes come out. Elderflowers, jasmines and chamomile type notes are present as the cup cools. The tasting notes include &quot;lemongrass&quot; as a descriptor but this is not something I really notice personally. I would describe the body of the cup as being a medium, I&#39;ve certainly had chewier cups but there is something there. . As an espresso I found this coffee to be very strong also. I ultimately landed on a 1:2.5 sort of ratio in around 22s (as is typical with my new grinder). Again the major note in the cup is the honey sweetness. As an espresso you can really notice just how &quot;clean&quot; this coffee is too. Unfortunately some of the more complex notes are a little harder to pick up on but it is still a fantastic cup and very drinkable. I would say as a filter is where this coffee shines however. . At this point the Plot Icon series has gone 10 for 10 in terms of picking some great coffees, I&#39;m very interested to see if they close out the year with a bang. . For the iconic jazz this week I found myself dusting off a 1973 release: &quot;Virtuoso&quot; by Joe Pass. . . Joe Pass is widely considered to be one of the all time great jazz guitarists. He often played with the likes of Oscar Peterson and, perhaps most famously, Ella Fitzgerald. In addition he also recorded with the likes of Milt Jackson, Zoot Sims, Herb Ellis, Count Basie and many more. His discography reads like a &quot;who&#39;s who&quot; of the jazz world spanning from the early 1960s through to his death in 1994. He has inspired countless jazz guitarists (and other musicians) through the years and is one of the first names you&#39;ll hear if you ask anybody to name a jazz guitarist - and for good reason. &quot;Virtuoso&quot; is considered one of the highlights of his career. We have to start by mentioning the title, it takes a certain amount of balls to release an album called &quot;Virtuoso&quot;. In doing so you essentially put a target on your back and every other musician picking up the album listens with an attitude of &quot;oh really?&quot;. This goes to show the ability of Joe, since nobody holds that against him (and in fact he even released follow up albums &quot;Virtuoso no.2&quot;, &quot;Virtuoso no.3&quot; and &quot;Virtuoso no.4&quot;). In fact &quot;Virtuoso&quot; even became somewhat of a blue-print for how all future solo jazz guitar should be played. Even now we can hear the influence in (for example) a modern player like Pasquale Grasso. . On &quot;Virtuoso&quot; Joe manages to combine his chord playing (although he didn&#39;t refer to them as chords rather: &quot;grips&quot;) with single note lines. While his chops are, obviously, impressive - it is the musicality with which he plays that is the real star. The album is made up of (almost) entirely standards and so there&#39;s a certain amount of &quot;respecting the tune&quot; that is required. There is often a temptation, especially when playing solo, to just throw all your chops and re-harmonization ideas at a tune. When the album is called &quot;Virtuoso&quot; that temptation is likely even stronger. But Joe manages to toe the line perfectly, managing to show off his enviable abilities but at the same time create something that is enjoyable to listen to. . The choice of tune on the album is fairly &quot;basic&quot;: they&#39;re pretty much all &quot;crowd pleaser&quot; type standards that we all know and love. This adds another level of pressure to the performance since we&#39;ve all heard these tunes performed in all variety of ways previously. There is one Joe Pass original on the album &quot;Blues for Alican&quot;, which as one would expect is a swinging jazzy blues. . Picking out my &quot;choice tunes&quot; on the album is very difficult here, each tune is a masterclass in jazz guitar and worthy of investigation. From the opening &quot;Night and Day&quot; which is pure Joe, through the improvised take on &quot;Cherokee&quot; featuring some manic single note lines, through the dark an pensive rendition of Monk&#39;s &quot;&#39;Round Midnight&quot;. . Perhaps the highlight of the album, however, is the stunning take on &quot;All The Things You Are&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). Which manages to mix some beuatiful voicings on the main melody with some toe-tapping high tempo swing and dazzling single-note lines. When I think of &quot;Virtuoso&quot; this is usually the first tune I think of. Another track that comes to mind is &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones?&quot; (above) - partly because it&#39;s not a tune that I know many good renditions of, but also due to Joe&#39;s use of walking basslines throughout. The album closer &quot;The Song Is You&quot; (below) is another highlight owing to Joe&#39;s playful use of timing throughout. . As with all of the &quot;Icon Series&quot; albums: &quot;Virtuoso&quot; is certainly in the &quot;essential listening&quot; category. If you are a fan of jazz guitar, or jazz in general, you owe it to yourself to check out Joe if he is new to you - and &quot;Virtuoso&quot; is possibly the best place to start. .",

            "title": "For Centennial Reasons and Montero Gesha",
            "content": "This week we have a bit of a special coffee on show. Whenever a gesha cultivar ends up in JazzCoffeeStuff HQ it is always a cause for celebration, but in this case the excitement doubles since it is from one of my favoruite coffee roasters (and one I don&#39;t get to purchase from as much as I&#39;d like) - Morgon, located in Gothenburg, Sweden. Unfortunately this means there is a high level of expectation behind this coffee so let&#39;s see if it can live up to it. . We have featured Gesha cultivars a few times in the blog before. As a quick reminder for those unfamiliar: the Gesha varietal quickly became the &quot;in&quot; cultivar during the mid-2010s owing to a coffee competition in Panama. This combined with how difficult it is to grow has led to prices reaching stratospheric levels. Of course as the popularity and demand increase there is also an increase in &quot;lower grade&quot; Gesha cropping up. These don&#39;t have the subtlety and flavour profiles of the top Gesha coffees and you&#39;re a bit beholden on importers/roasters to pick out the best lots. . Fortunately the roaster in question this week is Morgon. They have featured a few times in the blog in the past and are an all time favourite of mine. I&#39;ve yet to have anything less than stellar from them and I&#39;ve had some of my favourite coffees of the past few years from them. What I particularly respect is their &quot;no nonsense&quot; approach to coffee roasting, they don&#39;t try and claim there&#39;s any &quot;magic&quot; in what they&#39;re doing. They just pick good green coffee, treat it with respect and let it speak for itself. I was particularly interested in trying a Gesha from them because this slightly goes against the ethos I associate with them. . The coffee itself was grown in Tarrazu, Costa Rica. I have a bit of a soft spot for Costa Rican coffee as one of the first coffees that made me take specialty seriously was a Costa Rican. In this case the coffee comes from a farm owned by Carlos Montero - one of the most respected growers in Costa Rica. The processing is described as being &quot;natural&quot; but I do not have the exact details behind this. . So let&#39;s just dive in: as usual starting with the dry aroma I get the sophisticated floral bouquet you associate with Gesha. It is not a heavy hitter in this regard (nor would you expect it to be) - but it gives a hint towards the complexity in the cup. Alongside florals I get a sticky-fruity type of sweetness on the nose, perhaps reminiscent of boiled sweets. . As a filter using my trusted method: the first thing I notice is the sweetness of this coffee. This is not something I normally associate with Gesha, but I guess it is the &quot;Costa-Rica-ness&quot; coming through. I would describe the sweetness as being apricot or peach like and the bag descriptor of &quot;strawberry fields&quot; also seems relvant. Alongside of course you also have all the floral notes you would expect, these seem to come to the fore as the cup cools down a touch. The cup itself is very clean with just enough acidity to avoid being cloying. . Moving onto the espresso: for this coffee I found I had to grind very fine on the dial. With my new grinder I still had enough play to get to reasonable levels but I could forsee some grinders struggling to get fine enough to produce a good shot. Ultimately I landed with a 1:2.5 ratio is about 22s for best results on my set up. The flavour profile is essentially the same as the filter just more concentrated. Whereas the filter might be &quot;apricot juice&quot; the espresso is &quot;apricot syrup&quot;. As is typical with these sorts of coffees some of the more complex floral notes are lost at the more concentrated levels of espresso. . While the espresso is very good, for me the extra complexity from the filter makes it the more natural choice for this coffee. Despite the very high expectation levels I had for this coffee it certainly lives up to it. Morgon once again showing they know their stuff when it comes to coffee roasting and green selection. . For this weeks jazz we&#39;re hopping back to 2019 with the John Pizzarelli Trio and their tribute to Nat King Cole: &quot;For Centennial Reasons&quot;. . . This album is a bit different to others featured on this blog: it is the first album that (prominently) features singing. (The more eagle eared will note that there are some previously featured albums that do have &quot;singing&quot; but these tend to be 1 or 2 tracks on the album as opposed to the majority). This is simply down to my preference, I tend not to listen to many jazz vocalists. John Pizzarelli is perhaps best known as being the son of jazz guitar legend Bucky Pizzarelli. Bucky was one of the true pioneers and one of the first (along with the likes of George Van Eps) to push the use of a 7 string guitar for jazz - something that John has since carried the torch for. John started his career in the early 1980s often working with his father. After releasing a string of albums under his own name he has gone on to work with the likes of Paul McCartney and James Taylor. He also has a brother Martin Pizzarelli - a double bassist who appears on much of his recorded works. . John has also listed Nat King Cole as the main influence on his career. As such &quot;For Centennial Reasons&quot; is not the first tribute album he has recorded. There is also the 1994 release &quot;Dear Mr Cole&quot; and the 1996 follow up &quot;PS Mr Cole&quot;, you will also find countless Nat King Cole songs (or songs associated with him) dotted around his other albums. Following a couple of decades of career development and working on his craft I feel &quot;For Centennial Reasons&quot; is the most polished and complete of these however. . As a first vocalist to appear on this blog John Pizzarelli might appear a bit of an odd choice. He does not have a particularly strong nor unique voice, but what he does have is bags of charisma and charm to pull it off. As a live act he is one of the most enjoyable around and always puts on a great performance consisting of great music interspersed with jokes and anecdotes. I remember seeing an interview with him a few years ago where the reporter asks: &quot;on the New York scene your music isn&#39;t viewed as very cool, have you ever thought about changing your style?&quot; to which John responds: &quot;If you want to listen to a certain kind of music: my band is the best around. What can be cooler than that?&quot; . As you would expect from a tribute album the majority of the material comes from the Nat King Cole canon. John does however pen 2 original pieces: &quot;A Hundred Years from Now&quot; which one could certianly mistake for an undiscovered Nat King Cole recording. And also &quot;Nat King Cool&quot; one of two instrumental pieces on the album where John and the band can flex their chops. . The rest of the album is all about the swing however, over the years John has clearly fine-tuned every piece to find the optimal tempo and groove. With the focus being on swinging his way through a bunch of well known (and some less well known) tunes it is easy to overlook just how good a guitar player John is too. Some of the guitar solos and his trademark guitar-scat style is mindblowing on this album. . For the selected tracks this week I have taken the 3 tunes that John recorded promo videos for (each embedded in this blog). First we have the album opener &quot;Straighten Up and Fly Right&quot; - here John plays with the tempo and note accents of the original to make a track that really swings. Compared to his earlier recordings of this tune the version here just feels more polished and allows more of his personality to come through. This is one of the highlights of the album. Next we have the signature tune &quot;Get Your Kicks on Route 66&quot; - a signature tune for both Cole and Pizzarelli. Again by just subtly tweaking the timings and groove the song takes on a new life and it becomes an instant crowd-pleaser. The last select tune is &quot;It&#39;s Only a Paper Moon&quot; - perhaps a tune that one wouldn&#39;t necessarily associate with Nat King Cole, but it is one of my favourites. It is also one that features heavily in the John Pizzarelli repertoire. The version on the album represents the arrangement of the tune that John has been using live for the past decade or so and I think the only studio version he has of this arrangement so it is nice to get this one of disc. . &quot;For Centennial Reasons&quot; is a record well worth hunting down if you&#39;ve not heard it before. If you&#39;re a Nat King Cole fan you&#39;ll recognise a lot of the tunes here (even if you&#39;re not you&#39;ll recognise a few). If you&#39;re new to jazz or come from a &quot;pop&quot; background and sometimes struggle with the density of some of the instrumental music featured on this blog this might be a good record to use as a &quot;gateway drug&quot; into jazz. .",

            "title": "Out Here and Banko Gotiti",
            "content": "This week we head back to Devon based roaster: Crankhouse Coffee. Crankhouse have appeared on the blog a few times before and they&#39;re a very dependable roaster and regularly provide stellar coffee. As of late I&#39;ve noticed they&#39;re particularly good for the &quot;funkier&quot; styles of coffee with more ambitious processing methods. And this weeks coffee provides an example of this. . This weeks coffee comes from Yirgacheffe, Eithiopia - one of the more recognizable and prized growing regions within Ethiopia. The name of this coffee is: &quot;Banko Gotiti Anaerobic (Strawberry)&quot;. Banko Gotiti is the name of the wet-mill where the coffee is processed. As you would expect this coffee has undergone an anaerobic processing step within sealed containers at a specific temperature, this allows more complex and interesting flavours to develop. This particular lot has code-name &quot;strawberry&quot; which gives some indication as to what we can expect in the cup. As with many Ethiopian coffees the cultivar is just listed as &quot;heirloom&quot;. . Let&#39;s dive straight in to the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I am initially hit with a somewhat typical &quot;boozy&quot; note you&#39;d expect from a Yirgacheffe natural, however alongside this are some strong fruity notes and hints of chocolate and baking spices. Before even making a cup you can tell this is going to be a very complex cup. . As a filter the &quot;strawberry&quot; from the name is instantly apparent, along with the other notes we had on the nose. The best way I can describe the flavour is a dark chocolate liqueur with a strawberry cream type filling. But I could also be persuaded by a &quot;black forest gateau&quot; as a descriptor. As you would expect from a funky flavour profile such as this the cup is not the cleanest you&#39;ll ever have in your life but it is certainly not a &quot;farmyard&quot; natural either. The sweetness is very high and the acidity somewhat muted while the mouthfeel and body are fairly high. While the flavour profile is quite complex this cup is quite &quot;linear&quot; with temperature and the profile doesn&#39;t really change much as it cools. This quality means that while it&#39;s complex, you can enjoy it just as much as an everyday cup while doing other acitivities. . Moving over to the espresso side of things now. As you may recall I recently bought a new espresso grinder and I&#39;m still getting to grips with it. Usually I like to talk about how easy a coffee is to dial in, but that is hard until I get a good baseline with this grinder. That said I didn&#39;t have a single &quot;sink job&quot; with this coffee so I feel it can&#39;t be an absolute pig to dial in. I found that I liked a fairly short ratio with this one, around 1:2.1 or so, as with other coffees on this grinder I liked a pull time of 22s. Keeping things shorter emphasised the body and mouthfeel a bit more and going longer didn&#39;t really increase sweetness or clarity any more. The flavour profile is much the same as the filter and the &quot;dark chocolate strawberry liqueur&quot; comes through even stronger. To me this is really where this coffee shines, the filter was good but the espresso spectacular. . As you&#39;d expect from Crankhouse another good coffee that will be missed. I also like the price-point that Crankhouse hit with this (and other coffees) where it&#39;s a bit more expensive than your &quot;typical&quot; coffees but not an over-the-top unobtainium pricing. It allows you to try more of these super interesting quality coffees without busting the bank. . On the jazz side this week I found myself digging out a 2013 release: &quot;Out Here&quot; from the Christian McBride Trio. . . Christian McBride is one of the most critically acclaimed and in-demand jazz bassists out there today. His career started in the early 1990s and he has been consistently active ever since. He has worked with some of the greatest jazz musicians ever including: Joe Henderson, Pat Metheny, Chick Corea, Freddie Hubbard, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, Roy Haynes and many more. Outside of jazz he has even worked with the likes of Paul McCartney, Sting, Isaac Hayes, Carly Simon and others. Through the 2000s and 2010s he saw his career shift from being a &quot;new kid on the block&quot; to one of the pre-eminent artists in the jazz world. This is something that does not come easily. His personality and demeanour likely helped with this as he is one of a select few jazz musicians who can combine chops with genuine charisma and stage presence. This is very evident in his radio show on NPR &quot;Jazz Night in America&quot; - which is well worth a listen as it is always fulled with insights, stories and of course great music. On &quot;Out Here&quot; Christian is joined by two younger up and coming musicians in the form of: Christian Sands on the piano and Ulysses Owens Jr on the drums. Both of whom also appeared on McBride&#39;s other 2013 release &quot;People Music&quot;. While &quot;People Music&quot; leant more into original compositions in the post-bop style within the quintet format; &quot;Out Here&quot; is more of a straight swinging trio affair with 7 of the 9 tracks being standards. I feel this makes &quot;Out Here&quot; very approachable as an album, but that is not a slight at the musicianship. . Playing such &quot;simple&quot; swinging tunes there is no place to hide and as jazz has grown to become increasingly complex finding younger musicians who can really swing is increasingly rare. Under McBride&#39;s tutelage Sands and Owens do a fantastic job. The tunes are energetic amd the solos wild but respectful of the music. I&#39;m sure many other young musicians would have come in and thrown down needlessly show-y solos which would feel out of place. Sands in particular really stands out to me and this was probably the album that made me really take notice of him as a musician. . When curating an album of (mostly) standards track selection becomes crucially important. Obviously there are &quot;crowd pleaser&quot; standards that people want to hear, but an album consisting of these will typically get quickly forgotten. Instead you typically want to balance these with &quot;non-standard standards&quot; - tunes that few musicians have thought of interpreting. McBride has done a great job here, we have a few crowd pleasers: &quot;Cherokee&quot;, &quot;East of the Sun&quot; and the fantastic rendition of &quot;My Favourite Things&quot; (above) along with some slightly more obscure standards like &quot;Hallelujah Time&quot; (at the start of this post) and &quot;Easy Walker&quot; and then perhaps the highlight of the album: a take on Johnnie Taylor&#39;s &quot;Who&#39;s Making Love?&quot; (a Stax record classic). Albums like &quot;Out Here&quot; are easy to forget about or overlook, so it is fun to look back at these every now and again. While not a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; album in any sense, it acts as a great example of what happens when you get three musicians into a room and just let them play. It is a joy to hear the energy between all the musicians here. Of course the real standout is McBride&#39;s band leading and it is a shining example for any bass player on how to drive a tune forward. .",

            "title": "Extrapolation and Gakuyu Ini AA",
            "content": "This weeks featured roaster is Curve Coffee Roasters from Margate. As you may recall Curve have featured on the blog a few times and rarely disappoint. For my money they&#39;re one of the most dependable roasters around and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever got a &quot;bad&quot; coffee from them. . This time I ordered a Kenyan coffee from them. It is called: Gakuyu-Ini AA. It is a washed processed lot consisting of the classic Kenyan cultivars SL28 and SL34. As with other Kenyan coffees the &quot;AA&quot; refers to the screen size of the beans - AA being the largest size. When I first got into specialty coffee there was a lot of talk around whether AA or AB or PB are better in the cup, I don&#39;t believe there is any relation truth be told. I have had great coffees in all screen sizes and some duffers too. . I don&#39;t often go for Kenyan coffees, I enjoy them when I do but they&#39;re just not something I hunt down. I think everybody who&#39;s into coffee remembers the first time they tried a Kenyan coffee however because it is such an iconic and distinctive flavour profile. It is probably the easiest terroir to recognise. In recent years there have been movements within Kenya to produce more honey and naturally processed coffees (owing to the water usage of washed) - but I&#39;ve not yet tried any of them. It would be interesting to test how much of the &quot;Kenya-ness&quot; comes through with alternative processing methods. . Let&#39;s dive right into the coffee itself: as you would expect on the dry aroma there is a strong whack of blackcurrant. Before even tasting there is no confusing the origin of this coffee. Alongside there is a delicate herbaceous and perfumed note, but it takes some concentration to find these. . Diving into the filter: the first sip greats you with a big juicy cup. The blackcurrant note is so intense it is almost like Ribena and it has that sticky almost jammy mouthfeel also. If you favour flavour intensity this is definitely a good choice of coffee for you as it is a cup that smacks you round the head with the juicy fruity notes. Alongside the blackcurrant I noted down notes of rosehip and hibiscus as well as an almost mint-like herb note. As a cup it is quite complex and one to ponder over. Sometimes Kenyan coffees can be overly acidic, but this is not the case here. The acidity levels are high but not to the point of being uncomforable, owing to the great roasting by Curve. . Moving in to the espresso: this is where I often struggle with Kenyans. The acidity can get too much (especially for a coffee like this that is roast for filter) - but I found this one never got too battery-acid-y. I settled on a 1:2.5+ ratio for this coffee, going shorter didn&#39;t really increase the mouthfeel or body so it made sense to amplify the sweetness with a longer pull. As is the case with my new grinder I was running a 20s pull for optimal results (some would now call this a &quot;turbo shot&quot; or before an &quot;EKspresso&quot; but I just call it a shot, the names just feel like marketing). Some of the complexity of the filter is lost as an espresso but you&#39;re left with a very intense hit of blackcurrant jam. This is one of the best Kenyan&#39;s I&#39;ve had as an espresso in a while. It is easy to drink and highly enjoyable. . As expected Curve produce the goods again with another great coffee. I have no doubt that they will be a featured roaster on the blog again in the future. . On the jazz side this week I found myself digging out an album I had not listened to for many years: the 1969 debut recording from John McLaughlin: &quot;Extrapolation&quot;. . . John McLaughlin needs no introduction, he is one of the most commercially successful jazz guitarists of all time with a career spanning 7 decades (just about). He could have comfortably fit into the &quot;Icon&quot; series of posts because he is surely an icon (and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll end up there soon enough with some of his other work). His &quot;big break&quot; came when working for Miles Davis on the &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, &quot;A Tribute to Jack Johnson&quot; and other Miles hit albums. He is however best known for his work with fusion super-group &quot;Mahavishnu Orchestra&quot; which he formed and led. He is one of the revolutionaries of jazz guitar and was hugely influential in how distorted electric guitars were used in jazz. &quot;Extrapolation&quot; appeared before all this fame and acclaim however, upon its release John McLaughlin was relatively unknown. THe album was released on an independent British record label: Marmalade Records initially. Following John&#39;s fame from his work with Miles the album got re-released by Polydor records. The album features an all British line-up of McLaughlin on guitars, John Surman on saxes, Brian Odgers on bass and Tony Oxley on drums. At the time of recording they were all relatively unknown British musicians with very few select releases under their own names and a few side-man appearances. I think this is what gives &quot;Extrapolation&quot; such vibrancy, each player is playing with complete freedom not being tied down to tradition. . John is obviously most associated with &quot;fusion&quot;, but &quot;Extrapolation&quot; is perhaps the most &quot;jazz&quot; album in his his discography. If you have listened to Mahavishnu Orchestra and it&#39;s too much, then &quot;Extrapolation&quot; is a good place to start. You still get the signature &quot;widdly&quot; guitar playing of McLaughlin but it is less in your face. Reportedly jazz guitar supremo Joe Pass (who disliked Mahavishnu Orchestra and didn&#39;t consider it jazz) said upon hearing this album &quot;I guess he can play jazz&quot;. . While the album is closer to a traditional jazz sound than other records in the McLaughlin discography that doesn&#39;t mean it is not an ambitious project. The album takes a thematic approach to composition, John establishes a theme in one piece and then it might appear again later and be resolved. It is for that reason it makes most sense to listen to this album in one sitting from start to finish rather than picking out individual tracks. Owing to the format of this blog I can&#39;t really embed an entire album so consider the tracks here just a &quot;taster&quot;. . McLaughlin&#39;s compositional voice and guitar playing obviously take centre-stage on this album, but some of the most memborable parts come from saxophonist John Surman (certainly a musician who is underappreciated). While the album is not &quot;free-jazz&quot; in the strictest sense, Surman does bring an edge of free-jazz to keep things interesting. If &quot;Extrapolation&quot; is not an album you&#39;ve heard before it is definitely worth checking out. You can hear some of the early formings of the McLaughlin sound so if you&#39;re a Mahavishnu fan you&#39;ll definitely get a kick out of it. Conversely if you are not a fan of Mahavishnu it is far enough away from that sound to keep you entertained. The album manages to remain fresh even after all this time, if you were to tell somebody this was released in the 2020s they&#39;d unlikely question it. Even the recording quality for a (relatively) low-budget release on an indy label is pretty good. .",

            "title": "Wolo So and Jacu",
            "content": "On the blog this week we feature the latest coffees from my KaffeBox subscription. This time they feature Jacu Coffee Roastery ( https://www.jacu.no/ ) another roastery I haven&#39;t tried before. The coffee blog this week may be a little shorter than usual as I also recently took delivery of a new coffee grinder: . . The coffees supplied by KaffeBox this month were used as the first coffees to try this grinder out and compare to my old grinders back to back. As such I wasn&#39;t really giving the coffees themselves as much attention as usual. . On the filter side we have a washed Ethiopian coffee: Chelchele. The cultivar is just listed as &quot;Heirloom&quot; - which we have talked about many times in the past. Aside from this and the altitude (2000masl) I don&#39;t have all that much information about this one. On the nose I get the usual &quot;washed ethiopian&quot; profile of florals and stone fruits, but in addition a hint of spice. These flavour notes carry over to the cup along with a lemon citrus note. The cup quality is very clean as you would expect and the body and mouthfeel are quite low. It&#39;s not the sweetest nor the most acidic cup you&#39;ll ever have but it is very balanced. As a filter it is very easy to drink. . On the espresso side we have another Ethiopian coffee, but this time a natural: Tula. This time the cultivar has been listed as 74110 - one that I often see identified. It is always nice to see the cultivar listed, hopefully in time I will have enough of a back catalogue of coffees to really know how the 74110 differs from the Krume (for example). On the nose this coffee is completely different to Chelchele - it has a much bigger tropical fruit hit. These overpower any hint of floral or stone fruit notes that may be present. As an espresso I found this coffee rather flat using my old grinder compared to my new grinder which made it sing. Since the bag was small (125g) I couldn&#39;t dial each in to perfection but the difference was noticable. The coffee itself came across as quite a &quot;clean&quot; natural coffee and the tropical fruits were striking: I noticed notes of pineapple, passionfruits and papayas. Alongside these was quite a sharp acidity that I would describe as being a bit like a gooseberry. While this coffee does have the sweetness that comes from a natural process it definitely leans towards the acidic. I also found it likes to be in ratios longer than 1:2.5 - so you don&#39;t get too much in the way of body (which is fine by me!) . Given my love of Ethiopian coffee it was really great to see a pair of Ethiopians arrive as part of this month&#39;s KaffeBox delivery. Both of these coffees were very high quality and I&#39;ll definitely keep an eye out for Jacu again, I might order from them again in a few months after I really get to grips with the new grinder so I can tell how much of my enjoyment I can attribute to the grinder versus the coffee itself. . On the jazz side this week we&#39;re going to take a quick look at another 2021 release from UK based: Balimaya Project, with their album &quot;Wolo So&quot;. . . Balimaya Project may not be a name familiar to you, they were certainly new to me. By chance I was making my way through the 2021 jazz releases and &quot;Wolo So&quot; instantly grabbed my attention. The music is daring and complex yet still has heart and authenticity. Balimaya Project is a &quot;big band&quot; consisting of 16 members, led by Djembe player Yahael Camara Onono. The make-up of the band is not your typical &quot;jazz big band&quot;, the instrumentation consists largely of the traditional instruments used by the Mandé people of West Africa. As such this group falls into that &quot;no-mans land&quot; between Jazz and World Music where lots of great music lives but rarely gets the recognition it deserves. . The music itself is said to be based around the Mandé traditions and folklore, but having no experience with this I have no idea how closely Balimaya Project sticks to those traditions. What I can say however, is that music is fantastic. Alot of the focus is placed on creating a dense and multi-layered percussion track. There are plenty of polyrhythms and odd note groupings to get your teeth into. Despite this the music is incredibly easy to listen thanks to the &quot;party&quot; vibe to the music, you can get your music nerd on and try and understand what is going on rhythmically - or you can just get up and dance to it. This combination is something that is incredibly difficult to achieve. . While the focus is definitely on celebrating the culture of the Mandé people, Balimaya Project combines this with contemporary jazz stylings. There are horns and electric guitars there too, and they do not feel out of place. At times there are even hints of Frank Zappa, modern fusion and even prog-rock. Naturally perhaps the closest analogue in the jazz world is Sun Ra&#39;s Arkestra - but this comparison gives both artists a disservice. . It&#39;s rare to find such a fresh and unique sound, almost every release you can tie back to a specific set of influences. &quot;Wolo So&quot; manages to create an entire vibe all to itself, it feels almost pointless trying to describe the music itself - to understand it you have to listen to it. For me this is definitely a contender for &quot;album of the year&quot; and its a record that will be in my rotation for a while. It is definitely worth hunting down a copy, especially if you enjoy the few tracks dotted through this blog post. https://www.balimayaproject.com/ .",

            "title": "Ascenseur Pour L'échafaud and Icon 9",
            "content": "This week we take another trip back to the Plot Roasting Icon Series - this is the 9th instalment of this coffee subscription that has so far offered up some fantastic coffees. As you may remember the Icon series is meant to represent the best, most interesting and rare coffees that Plot offer. . The coffee featured is another from Diego Bermudez - a farmer who has featured many times on the blog previously. One of the true masters of the &quot;alternative processing&quot; methods. This time the coffee showcases how a careful processing can elevate even the most humble of cultivars: in this case a Castillo lot. The Castillo is the result of years of experimentation to develop a cultivar that is suitably resistant to leaf rust. It can trace its lineage through the &quot;Colombia&quot; cultivar which is itself a hybrid of robusta and arabica (specifically the hybrid of Timor Hybrid and Caturra). The Castillo (named after researcher Jamie Castillo) is favoured for its resistance but the cup quality is not quite as sought after as some other cultivars - if careful processing can make a big difference to cup quality this offers many positives for the future of coffee. . The process undertaken on this &quot;Red Plum&quot; lot is: an initial fermentation at 19 celcius for 28 hours followed by a pulping and another fermentation for 40 hours at 21 celcius. The seeds then undergo a &quot;thermal shock&quot; washing first at 40 celcius then at 12 celcius. The coffee is then dried for 28 hours at 42 celcius and a relative humidity of 25% until the moisture content is 10-11%. It is no wonder that coffees from Diego Bermudez end up costing so much. . Unlike earlier Icon offerings this coffee was offered in a reasonable sized bag which means I was able to dial in both espressos and filter coffees this week. . Diving right into the dry aroma: as you would expect from the processing the intial hit is sweet tropical fruits. This is certainly a &quot;fruit bomb&quot; style aroma that is very punchy and intense. The smell when grinding is also incredible and fills the room, who needs an essential oil diffuser? . In the filter the first thing I noticed was the intense sweet-candy quality to this coffee. The flavour notes on the bag say: &quot;like a bag of skittles&quot; and frankly that is a perfect descriptor. You also get a candy-floss sort of quality too, it&#39;s quite a &quot;clean&quot; sweetness of candy-floss as opposed to say a caramel. Alongside you also get the tropical fruit notes on the nose: watermelon and papaya are the two I wrote down, the official flavour notes say strawberry and pineapple. The sweetness is balanced with some acidity but it is note a battery acid coffee by any means. The body and mouthfeel are low, some might even say a bit hollow. If you&#39;re a fan of more traditional &quot;big&quot; feeling coffees this won&#39;t be one for you. . Onto the espresso: I had one issue here, this coffee grinds very coarse - so even at the minimum setting on my grinder I could only get to a 1:2.5 ratio in about 25s. Thankfully this is where this coffee liked to be so it was not a big issue, but with different equipment I could see this coffee being a real hassle. When dialed in however you&#39;re left with a more intense and concentrated version of the filter coffee - full of candy and tropical fruits. . Overall I prefered this one slightly more as a filter but it was still great as an espresso. Plot knocked it out of the park again with the Icon series and I&#39;ll be eagerly awaiting what the 10th edition holds. . For the iconic jazz this week I decided to introduce Miles Davis to the blog. . . Miles is somebody who I&#39;ve been in two minds about including on this blog. The first reason being that the world doesn&#39;t need yet another recommendation for &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (although it is fantastic). Miles is so well known and there&#39;s so much information out there already I&#39;m not sure I have much to add. The second reason is: personally I do not enjoy anything Miles released from &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; and beyond. . Instead I have decided to take a bit of a different track with this post and talk about: &quot;Ascenseur Pour L&#39;échafaud&quot; - both the album/soundtrack and the film itself (in the English speaking world this is typically referred to as: &quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot; or sometimes &quot;Lift to the Scaffold&quot;). &quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot; is a 1958 film from Louis Malle adapted from a 1956 novel of the same name by Noël Calef. Outside of jazz and coffee I also enjoy classic film-noir - &quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot; is not strictly a noir but it does have many elements that could be considered noir. As a film it also helped establish some of stylistic elements of French New Wave and New Modern Cinema. . The plot revolves around a pair of lovers Florence and Julien who decide to kill Florence&#39;s husband. Julien does this by climbing via a rope into the husband&#39;s office, shooting him, then leaving the scene to look like a suicide. Unfortunately he leaves the rope outside and so has to re-enter the building to retreive it. It is at this time he boards the elevator just as the security man turns off the power to the building for the evening and so Julien is stuck in the elevator between floors. As this is happening Julien&#39;s getaway car gets stolen by low level crooks who then find themselves accidentally (and unbeknownst to them) involved in a murder. The film follows how this whole situation begins to spiral out of control. . It is clear to see why many associate this film with &quot;noir&quot; given the plot-line, however stylistically it is very different. It is shot in a much more &quot;artistic&quot; way than a typical noir - some might even say more &quot;pretentious&quot;. It is certainly a style that will divide people, but personally I think the blend of the noir and new wave is seamless. The biggest departure from typical noir however is the soundtrack from Miles. . The soundtrack is fairly brief, in its original form around 26 minutes in length (with alternate takes and so on current releases are much longer). The magic of the soundtrack however is the fact the entire thing was improvised when watching the film. This in itself is quite remarkable, but add to that the soundtrack also features some incredible jazz and memorable hooks that stick with you. It is really a testament to how good of a musician Miles really was, he manages to capture the mood of the film perfectly. Without his soundtrack I do wonder how good this film would be, often film soundtracks just fade into the background - but in this case it is an integral part of the whole vibe the film gives off. . In terms of choice tracks the most memorable is likely &quot;Générique&quot; which accompanies Jeanne Moreau walking through the French streets (embedded at the start of this post). It creates the perfect melancholy and loneliness that required and truly transforms the scene. As a result this has become one of the most iconic and best loved scenes in film history, without Miles it would not have this acclaim. Another piece that stands out to me is &quot;Sur l&#39;autoroute&quot; (above) - a frantic bop inspired piece that captures the spirit of a getaway drive. My other choice track is the below &quot;Chez le photographe du motel&quot; - which features at the films climax (which I shall not give spoilers to). It manages to encompass the entire film&#39;s feeling and provide a resolution and closure. Ordinarily I talk about &quot;essential listening&quot; in these Icon series posts, in this case we have &quot;essential watching&quot; - as great as the soundtrack is as a standalone piece of work, to truly appreciate it I think you need to watch the film to see how it all fits together. So if you&#39;ve exhausted Netflix and are looking for a piece of classic cinema to watch you could do much worse than hunting down &quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot;. .",

            "title": "Times Tales and Bombe",
            "content": "This week we are heading back to a roaster who has appeared on the blog before: Curve Coffee Roasters located in Margate. The guys and girls at Curve really know what they&#39;re doing and I&#39;ve not been disappointed from them in the past. I was, therefore, very much looking forward to this coffee. . As the washed Ethiopian coffees have started to become available it comes as no surprise that this coffee is another washed Ethiopian. These are the coffees that really get me excited and given a choice what I would choose at least 90% of the time. I don&#39;t have a huge amount of information about this coffee, I know that it has undergone a dry fermentation process, the cultivars are &quot;heirloom&quot; and it is produced my a collection of small-holder farmers located in the Bombe Mountains within the Sidama region. . Without further ado let&#39;s dive into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma you get everything you would expect from a coffee from this region. You&#39;re greeted with a big hit of peach and stone fruits along with the usual jasmine florals. Alongside this is a sweet honey type note to pull everything together. The aromas are punchier than you might ordinarily expect from a washed Ethiopian coffee but you could hardly describe it as a heavy hitter. It&#39;s the sort of aroma that makes you want to start brewing. . As usual we&#39;ll start by looking at the coffee as a filter. I usually find this is the best way to judge a coffee (at least compared to espresso) since the technique is not too demanding - although the forum, discord, YouTube and Insta coffee communities do enjoy making things more complicated than need be. In the cup I would describe this as quite a &quot;soft&quot; coffee, it is not one that will demand your attention and it is very balanced so you don&#39;t get distracted by it. It&#39;s the sort of cup that can fit into your day: if you want to sit and appreciate flavours you can, but if you don&#39;t want to that&#39;s cool too. The flavour profile itself is the same as on the dry aroma: peaches, florals and honey. The flavour leans heavily towards the peach and stone fruit end of things, the florals are there but they&#39;re not &quot;in your face&quot;. This is a cup that improves as it cools (up to a point) in my experience, so try to hold off slurping it down in a few seconds - although that does take some restraint. . Moving onto all things espresso: this one is fairly forgiving on grind size and recipe, as long as you don&#39;t do a super slow pull things should be tasty. I find 1:2.5 is about right and I look for around 7s pre-infuse then a 24s pull. What you&#39;re left with is concentrated peach juice sweetened with some honey. The body and mouthfeel is not very big no matter what you do so pulling a little longer than a standard 1:2 allows for a bit more flavour separation which is a good compromise in my book. The aftertaste is extremely clean and not long lived, it makes Bombe very easy to shot. . It comes as no surprise that Curve did a good job roasting this coffee, and it&#39;s another solid washed Ethiopian. It seems like the washed Ethiopians are very strong this season (although it might be I have just been waiting for so long). I&#39;m sure Curve will feature on the blog again and I&#39;m certain this won&#39;t be the last from Ethiopia we&#39;ll see this year. . On the jazz side this week I found myself digging out an album from 2014: Jeff Ballard Trio&#39;s &quot;Time&#39;s Tales&quot;. . . Jeff Ballard may not be a name you are instantly familiar with. However, if you have any familiarity with jazz you have likely heard his playing before. As a side-man he has appeared on albums from Chick Corea, Joshua Redman, Pat Metheny and Kurt Rosenwinkel. He is probably most famous for being the long-term drummer in the Brad Mehldau trio, having been appointed to that position in 2005. Given the popularity of these artists he is likely one of the most successful modern drummers based on album sales (although I have not crunched any numbers for this). The Jeff Ballard Trio consists of Jeff Ballard on drums (unsurpirsingly), Lionel Loueke on electric guitars and Miguel Zenon on alto saxophone. Lionel Loueke is one of the more interesting modern jazz guitarists around, he takes a lot of his influence from West African music and combines this with Xhosa-inspired vocal lines using the &quot;click&quot; sounds in a similar way to the &quot;scat&quot; sounds more familiar to jazz listeners. Miguel Zenon is no slouch either, it is safe to say he is firmly in the &quot;free&quot; camp in terms of jazz and has a strong influence of Ornette Coleman in his playing. Perhaps most notable within his playing is his ability to play complex polyrhythmic ideas with ease. The Jeff Ballard Trio is therefore a heavy hitting modern jazz trio. . &quot;Time&#39;s Tales&quot; is really quite an ambitious album. It covers a lot of ground and styles from simple ballads, to heavy rock fusion, to world music and free jazz. The musicians make these transitions seamless and the whole album remains coherent and not just a big mess of tunes thrown together. Jeff&#39;s drum lines and ability to swing through even the most complicated rhythmic signatures is what really holds the whole thing together. Without having a bassist to lean back on the trio relies on the drummer to keep them grounded, but in &quot;Time&#39;s Tales&quot; case this doesn&#39;t equate to &quot;boring, safe&quot; drumming. . One of the highlights of the album is the track &quot;Beat Street&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). It kicks off with a twisting melody played by Zenon and Loueke in unison on top of a complicated meter. This quickly gives way to Zenon&#39;s solo which showcases his Coleman inspired free lines. This leads into Loueke&#39;s solo which takes influence from world music before Ballard gives a polyrhythmic masterclass in his solo. The magic of the piece is hearing how all three musicians stay true to their individual styles and preferences yet still serve the tune. . The next tune I want to highlight is &quot;Hanging Tree&quot; (above). The influence here is clearly &quot;rock&quot; music and it features Loueke playing distorted guitar in a way I&#39;ve not heard him play before. This is a tune that could easily be considered &quot;fusion&quot; or even &quot;jazz-punk&quot;. On the album it is a bit of an outlier which makes it all the more memorable. It also gives Ballard a chance to play with more aggression which increases the energy and adds a nice flow to the track listing. Another personal highlight of mine is Zenon&#39;s arrangement of Silvio Rodriguez&#39;s &quot;El Reparador de Suenos&quot; (above). Rooted firmly in the Afro-Cuban tradition the track swings with syncopated style and elegance. Here Zenon and Loueke do not opt to play in unison but play contrasting lines that seem to fit perfectly. The interplay between all members is an absolute pleasure to hear, Ballard&#39;s drumming pushes and pulls throughout creating tension only to release it at the optimal point. It is a very refreshing take on the Afro-Cuban style. . While I selected 3 tracks here I could have equally selected any of the others to feature. The Gershwin ballad &quot;The Man I Love&quot; is simply sublime as is the take on Bela Bartok&#39;s &quot;Dal&quot;. The improv pieces &quot;Free 1&quot; and &quot;Free 3&quot; are also worthy of note as is the Loueke penned &quot;Virgin Forest&quot;. If I were to write this blog on another day I could have easily featured a completely different set of tracks. As is the strength of this album. . &quot;Time&#39;s Tales&quot; is unlikely to feature in any &quot;essential listening&quot; album list you&#39;ll ever find, but it is still worthy of your time if it is one that is unfamiliar to you. It is a great example of what a modern jazz trio can do, it takes influence from the past but is not beholden to it. I consider this album a bit of an &quot;underrated gem&quot; from the mid 2010s, so be sure to hunt down a copy if you like what you&#39;ve heard/read. .",

            "title": "The Humble Warrior and La Claudina",
            "content": "For the coffee this week we are heading back to Bath&#39;s finest: Round Hill Roastery. These guys have appeared on the blog many times in the past and rarely disappoint, they&#39;re one of the roasters I always find myself going back to because they&#39;re so reliable. . When this coffee arrived I had a bit of a glut of coffee to get through, so this coffee has been sitting in my freezer for a good few weeks. Typically I don&#39;t like freezing coffee and I like to keep a rolling supply going rather than keep a large freezer back log. This is largely down to superstition. When I first got into specialty coffee many moons ago all the advice said &quot;never freeze coffee&quot; and so this has kind of stuck with me. We know better now however, and plenty of people get amazing results from freezing. In the back of my mind I&#39;m always worried about trapped humidity etc. in the bag causing issues. Fortunately with this weeks coffee I did not see any ill effects (although I didn&#39;t try a &quot;non-freezed&quot; version to compare). . The coffee itself is from a farm called La Claudina in Colombia. This particular lot consists of Colombia and Caturra cultivars and what makes the coffee particularly interesting is the &quot;extended fermentation&quot; processing. The coffee cherries ferment in water for 24 hours and then dry ferment for 24 hours. This farm adjusts these processing methods on different lots to achieve different results. This particular example has been &quot;extended&quot; compared to their usual approach, so I am expecting a bit of a funky vibe to this one. . Diving into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I get notes of rich caramels and sweet dark berries. It does not give off an obvious &quot;funk&quot; note but you can tell it&#39;s got a &quot;natural&quot; thing going on. On the nose it is fairly punchy but is not a complete fruit-bomb sort of coffee. It is certainly inviting, however. . As a filter brewed in the usual way: the funky note is quite apparent. This may be because I don&#39;t typically take the funky bus often. It doesn&#39;t have the real farm-yard natural funk that some have, but it is noticable. I would describe it more as a fermented fruit sort of funk instead of a boozy funk. In terms of flavour notes the dark berry notes from the nose are certainly at the forefront for me. Alongside is a little tropical fruit edge and just a hint of herbaceous florality. In terms of profile I would say the acidity and sweetness are medium and the body is fairly high. The cup is quite &quot;linear&quot; as it cools, so you don&#39;t get too many surprises. The aftertaste is quite longlasting but pleasant. For a natural this funky it is not a muddy sludgefest, there is still a decent amount of clarity (but nothing like the washed Ethiopian&#39;s of the past couple of weeks). . This coffee for me is more at home as an espresso (as always I still only buy the filter roast option). The bigger body and heavier dark fruit notes are more at home in the concentrated form. The funkiness in the filter is somewhat lost as an espresso however. After a bit of playing I settled on a ratio of 1:2.25. This seemed to highlight the body and mouthfeel while being just long enough for good flavour separation. As an espresso it is one you do not really have to think about, it is extremely easy to pull and extremely easy to drink. The flavour profile is much the same as in the filter but in concentrated form you also get a sort of jammy quality too, it is a slightly &quot;sticky&quot; sort of mouthfeel which is quite nice. If you think of redcurrant jelly as you&#39;d have on a roast dinner it&#39;s not a million miles away. . As expected Round Hill delivered the goods again and show just how reliable they are as a roaster. I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be too long until they feature on the blog once again. . For the jazz side this week I found myself listening to a 2020 release that slipped my attention: Wayne Escoffery&#39;s &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; on the Smoke Sessions label. . . I&#39;ll admit I dropped the ball on this one, I should have checked this out months ago. I love some of the music being put out on the Smoke Sessions label but I find it hard to remember individual albums because they all have near identical cover art. As a result I create fake memories of hearing a particular album because I mistake it for another. Thankfully I managed to notice my error with &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot;. Wayne is perhaps best known for his work with the Mingus Big Band (with whom he won a Grammy) but he has an equally impressive resume playing with the likes of Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Jimmy Cobb and Monty Alexander among others. He is also a long standing member of the Tom Harrell quintet. He also holds the prestigious position &quot;lecturer of jazz improvisation&quot; at Yale. Under his own name he has half a dozon or so albums, and his previous release &quot;Vortex&quot; from 2018 won him a lot of plaudits cementing him as one of the pre-eminent saxophonists working today. . &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; features Wayne&#39;s usual quartet along with a couple of interesting guest spots: . Wayne Escoffery: Saxophone | David Kikoski: Piano | Ugonna Okegwo: Bass | Ralph Peterson: Drums | Randy Brecker: Trumpet | David Gilmore: Guitar | . You can feel the sense of familiarity between the core band throughout the album. Wayne seems to place a high level of trust in his musicians and it feels more like a group collaborative effort than a band playing the leaders compositions. This shows a lot of maturity as a band leader and the music benefits from it. Kikoski and Okegwo each even get a writing credit for the tracks &quot;Undefined&quot; and &quot;Back to Square One&quot; respectively. . The album gets its title as a tribute to the many jazz greats we have lost in recent years: musicians who acted like warriors yet allowed the music to keep them humble. As quite a softly spoken character himself, it feels as though this is also a good way to describe Wayne Escoffery. But make no mistake: once the music starts he is capable of creating some of the most intense and complex fire breathing solos around. . A big part of &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; is dedicated to a jazz re-interpretation of Benjamin Britten&#39;s &quot;Missa Brevis In D&quot; - and this is perhaps the major statement on the album. It is expertly crafted, it takes just enough liberties to be interesting but it does not apply so many re-harmonizations that the piece itself becomes unrecognizable. This is a difficult line to draw and one where many jazz musicians fail in interpreting classical pieces. As a young child Escoffery was a member of a boys choir, and given the popularity of &quot;Missa Brevis in D&quot; with choirs, this is likely where the inspiration came from. One of the standout moments of this re-interpretation is in &quot;Benedictus&quot; where Wayne&#39;s son Vaughn Escoffery (11 years old) adds vocals to double his father&#39;s sax lines. . Of the two Escoffery original compositions the title track gives the comtemplative and respectful quality one would expect knowing the back story. It features quite a complex twisting melody featuring some breathtaking interplay between Escoffery and Brecker. It manages to shock and amaze but at the same time remain entirely approachable, marking Escoffery as a &quot;Humble Warrior&quot; indeed. Of course the track also acts as a fantastic &quot;canvas&quot; for the soloists, with Escoffery building from tasteful almost vocal lines through to full frenetic madness but always staying in total control. Another standout track for me is Gildo Mahones&#39; ballad: &quot;Quarter Moon&quot;. On this Wayne shows he does not need to rely on his awe inspiring technique and harmonic knowledge to get the job done. He can play a sensitive and caring ballad as well as anybody, something that is becoming a bit of a lost art in modern jazz. I have to admit that &quot;Quarter Moon&quot; was not a piece I was familiar with before listening to this album, but it has become a firm favourite. . Overall &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; is a great example of what modern jazz can be. It is one I&#39;ve had on solid rotation for the past week or so. If you&#39;re looking for something new to listen to that is complex yet approachable, respects jazz of the past but still makes a statement itself - you should really hunt down a copy of &quot;The Humble Warrior&quot; as it&#39;s a thoroughly enjoyable listen. .",

            "title": "Sounds From The Ancestors and Dimtu Hambella",
            "content": "This week we head back to the fine folks at Plot coffee roasting, I always seem to be raving about them on this blog but they continue to knock it out of the park. . In the past I have talked about how much I enjoy washed Ethiopian coffees, if I see one on a cafe&#39;s bean selection it will take something special to draw me away from trying it. We are now heading into the part of the year when all the washed Ethiopian coffees are starting to land, I believe this was actually the inspiration for the Andy Williams song: &quot;It&#39;s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year&quot; (citation needed). This brings a lot of excitement to JazzCoffeeStuffHQ but also lots of headaches in trying to decide which ones I want to buy and from which roasters. Plot is sort of a no brainer option to kick off the season. . This particular coffee is from a washing station owned by Israel Degfa - an inpsiring man who does a lot of amazing work for the community in Ethiopia, we have talked about him at length in previous posts so we won&#39;t re-tread the same ground here. The location of the washing station is in Hambella Dhekbor within the Guji zone of the Oromia region. Each region/zone of Ethiopia has its own &quot;flavour profile&quot; so those more familiar with Ethiopian coffee might know what to expect from a washed Guji. The cultivars for this coffee have not been identified and are simply listed as &quot;landrace varieties&quot;, it would have been nice to get some more detail but this is not always possible. For those who worry about altitude of the area is at 1850-2200 MASL - so certainly on the higher end! . Let&#39;s not waste any more time and get straight into the coffee itself. On the dry aroma I don&#39;t get a particularly intense bouquet. As you would expect on the nose it is quite delicate and restrained but with a lot of floral complexity. It is quite hard to pick out individual notes because the aroma is so feint. As I&#39;ve said before I don&#39;t believe a &quot;weak nose&quot; means &quot;weak in the cup&quot;, I think it&#39;s a false equivalency many new to coffee make. I think the reverse might actually be true, the more volatiles given off leave less to be in the bean to be extracted - but this is just my supposition, I have no evidence to back this up. . Going in as a filter: the first sip I had made me sit back and take note. This is a very striking coffee, it is vibrant, zingy, sparkly, clean and extremely tasty. It also has a boat load of complexity and really changes character through the lifetime of the cup. The main flavour notes I get are a really crisp dry lemonade, green apples, lime along with a ton of floral character in the back: lavendar, jasmine and violet. The peach or apricot note you often get is a little overpowered by the heavier acidic fruit flavours here and it doesn&#39;t have a strong black-tea note like some. This makes it quite a neat take on a washed Guji and keeps it very interesting. . As an espresso I&#39;ve found this one is really quite forgiving on my set-up. I ultimately settle for 1:2.5 in around 25s which is a fairly typical recipe for me, I generally start there but with this one I found no reason to experiment any further. Unlike some floral coffees the floral notes are still at the forefront in the concentrated form, this makes for one of the more complex espresso shots you&#39;re likely to taste. Based on the acidity in the filter one might expect the espresso to be prone to &quot;battery acid&quot; but this is really not the case, it is certainly a crisp acidic espresso but it was not once overbearing. It is not likely to be a shot for those chasing the big bodied chewy traditional espresso styles but I think it is one that can appeal to those starting to stray into the more acidic lighter roast realms. . All in all another knock out by Plot (not that I&#39;d expect anything less). These sorts of coffees are really my favourites, I love tasting the &quot;unobtainium&quot; hyper-coffees with crazy processing and cultivars: but there&#39;s something special about finding really tasty coffees at reasonable enough prices. If I operated a cafe I would be very happy to make this one my &quot;house&quot; option while it is available. . In addition to the washed Ethiopian coffee season: another event that adds an air of excitement to the JazzCoffeeStuffHQ is a new album from Kenny Garrett. This is what we&#39;re going to take a look at today: &quot;Sounds From The Ancestors&quot; . . This album was released yesterday, so this blog will very much just be my initial impressions rather than any deep takes on the pieces. I&#39;ve done this with a couple of albums in the past, at one point I might go back and do a retrospective to compare my initial thoughts to how I feel after more serious listening. . Kenny has featured on the blog previously so if you&#39;d like more a background on him there&#39;s a good place to go. For my money Kenny is the most reliable jazz performer in the world today. His live shows are simply fantastic, he doesn&#39;t have a huge &quot;stage persona&quot;, he doesn&#39;t relay stories or jokes to the crowd, he doesn&#39;t use light shows or expansive backdrops and he doesn&#39;t ham it up with over-exaggerated mannerisms to elicit a response from the crowd. Instead he just gets to work, serves the music and has the audience eating out of the palm of his hand. If you have not had a chance to go to one of his shows I strongly suggest going. So let&#39;s get into &quot;Sounds From The Ancestors&quot; a bit. As the name suggests the whole album feels a bit like a nod to those that came before him. If you have heard an album from Kenny in the past decade or so you&#39;ll know he has been taking more and more of an influence from &quot;non-jazz&quot; music (but make no mistake he is still a jazz heavyweight). This is noticable on the album, you have influences from hip-hop, afro-cuban jazz, Asian classical music, soul/rnb along with a whole host of other jazz influences. My ear is quite attuned to the melodic minor scales that make up a large part of Kenny&#39;s playing (he loves the Mix flat 6 in particular over dominant chords), but I see him playing more and more with what I believe is the Hirajoshi or &quot;Japanese Pentatonic&quot; scale in his later work. . This album is also noticable for the inclusion of vocalists, something Kenny hasn&#39;t really used too much in the past (aside from the odd piece or the throat singing on &quot;Pushing the World Away&quot;). The vocalists don&#39;t really sing &quot;songs&quot; however, the voices are used as additional instruments in the arrangement. They are often doubling lines or providing additional harmony to extend the depth of the mix. I can imagine live this will lead to a lot of audience interaction with Kenny essentially playing the audience as a &quot;piano&quot; of sorts. . It is also fantastic to hear Kenny further expand rhythmically (the tracks contain tributes to legendary jazz drummers Art Blakey and Tony Allen). On the last few albums he began to dip his toe into poly-rhythms but he has taken this much further. This is perhaps most noticable on &quot;For Art&#39;s Sake&quot; where the drum and percussion players lay down a really complex but grooving meter. There is a really mind blowing section of poly-rhythm which I believe is something in 6 played over something in 7, but I&#39;ll need to listen to this more to get my ear in and really nail down what is going on. . One of the stand-out pieces for me is the second track &quot;Hargrove&quot; (clearly a tribute to late trumpeter Roy Hargrove). He captures the vibe of the jazz-hip-hop crossover that characterised the Hargrove sound, however he still manages to inject the Garrett sound. I believe this track could act as an incredibly powerful &quot;gateway drug&quot; for those in the neo-soul and jazz-hip-hop scene looking to start their journey into the heavier end of jazz. . The track &quot;It&#39;s Time to Come Home&quot; captures the afro-cuban side to Kenny&#39;s playing perfectly. It feels like a modern update to the sound of another great Kenny: Dorham. For the hardcore Garrett fans it also features some cool little throwback licks to older pieces in his repertoire. Overall &quot;Sounds From The Ancestors&quot; is incredibly complex, exciting and even to this day Kenny is pushing into new ground. Despite all the complexity (you can really spend an age trying to work out what&#39;s going on with some of these pieces) it is surprisingly approachable and you don&#39;t require a music degree to enjoy the music (something that can&#39;t be said for some modern jazz). I feel this is an album worthy of the hype and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s one I&#39;ll keep coming back to, but this is hardly a surprise from a Kenny Garrett album. .",

            "title": "Music and Solberg and Hansen",
            "content": "This week we take a look at the August edition of the KaffeBox subscription. This month the featured roaster is Solberg &amp; Hansen located in Oslo, Norway. What makes Solberg &amp; Hansen particularly interesting is they were established in 1879 - which in itself is quite remarkable. Most of the roasters featured on this blog were only established in the 2000s (with possibly one or two creeping into the 90s). This makes Solberg &amp; Hansen the oldest coffee roaster in Norway and one of the oldest in the world. . My only previous experience with Solberg &amp; Hansen has been from another coffee subscription I have for decaf coffee, and that one was probably a top 5 decaf of all time for me. So I have high hopes for the coffee this week. Unlike in previous KaffeBox offerings we only have one coffee supplied in a 250g bag this time, which means we can really dig into it as both a filter and an espresso. Which makes a change from the previous KaffeBox &quot;split&quot; blog posts. . The coffee itself is called Chelbesa, grown in Gedeo, Gedeb in Ethiopia. The coffee is processed at the Danche washing station. The coffee has undergone a 72 hour wet fermentation before beging washed and then soaked for a further 2 hours and dried over the course of 10 days. Unlike many Ethiopian coffees the cultivars have been identified as consisting of Wolicho and Kurume - this is a trend I am very in favour of and hope it becomes common practice. . This Chelbesa is a coffee I have had a few times before from other roasters so I have a good idea of what to expect in the cup. Fortunately it is a coffee that I have enjoyed in the past so one I am looking forward to trying again. . On the dry aroma I get the usual floral and stone fruit notes you associate with a washed Ethiopian coffee like this, however I also get lots of caramel and toffee notes too. I believe this is due to the coffee being a little more developed than you&#39;d typically expect from a Nordic roaster. You can tell this is a more &quot;traditional&quot; roaster compared to some of the &quot;new kids on the block&quot; and there is nothing wrong with that. . As a filter Chelbesa is very similar to how I remember it. I would describe the coffee as very &quot;soft&quot;, I can&#39;t really think of a better word to use. While some Ethiopian coffees are vibrant, others are very perfumed, Chelbesa has a soft almost marshmallow quality to it. This is more a textural or sensory experience than it is a taste thing. In terms of flavours you have all the usual suspects coming to play: peaches, apricots, jasmine, floral, black tea - everything you want in a washed Ethiopian. It does not have much in the way of citrus like some however. It is a complex cup that really changes with temperature and it&#39;s one you can drink almost to the point of being &quot;cold&quot; and it doesn&#39;t become too harsh. It is relatively low in acidity (for an Ethiopian) and fairly sweet with a good amount of body. I wouldn&#39;t describe it as a &quot;typical washed Ethiopian&quot; but it is a nice twist on a theme. . As an espresso there are a few things to note. The first of which is that owing to the &quot;soft&quot; and restrained quality of the coffee you can pull really concentrated shots without things getting harsh or muddled. The slightly more developed roast helps in this regard too as it makes it incredibly easy to extract. I stuck to the tradtional 1:2 with about 7s pre-infuse then a 27s pull with this one. It&#39;s not often I use a recipe like this. I did bump the temperature up a little bit which did seem to add a touch more vibrancy to the cup. The flavour profile is much like the filter: peaches, apricots, black tea and plenty of florals. If you imagine a sweet peach iced tea that you reduced down to a syrup you wouldn&#39;t be too far off. . Overall I think I enjoyed this coffee more as an espresso than I did filter but both were enjoyable and had some interesting characteristics. Another good choice by KaffeBox and as always I&#39;ll look forward to the next month&#39;s offering. . For the jazz this week I found myself reaching for a record released in 1989 - french pianist Michel Petrucciani&#39;s &quot;Music&quot;. . . Michel is quite an inspiring character, being born with osteogenesis imperfecta (&quot;brittle bone disease&quot;) leading to him being short and often in a lot of pain - he still managed to become one of the greatest jazz pianists of his generation. Inspiring and influencing countless musicians during his relatively short career in the 80s and 90s. Michel&#39;s style was particularly interesting for the period. During the 80s and early 90s fusion ruled the roost with many players ditching the acoustic instruments and playing rock inspired pieces. In contrast Michel was a bit of a throw back, he had a much more lyrical and contemplative and was often compared to Bill Evans. He was a more multi-faceted player than being just a straight Evans clone however, he also combined this with blazing virtuosity (and given the pain he experienced while playing this is no mean feat) along with wider influences from the sounds of Paris, Brazil and elsewhere. That&#39;s not to say he couldn&#39;t hang with the fusion boys too (for example on the fantastic &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; - which may appear in a future blog post at some point). . Music marked the start of Michel&#39;s experimentation with synthesizers and richer and more expansive arrangements. Unlike other records from the era the use of synth is very tasteful and often features as an instrument that doubles a piano line or is deeper in the mix to just add depth. This avoids the album feeling and sounding &quot;dated&quot; by today&#39;s standards, which cannot be said for a lot of albums released in the late 80s (as much as I love some of them). . The line-up on Music is fairly fluid, with musicians subbing in and out on the various tracks of the album. This does not stop it feeling like a single cohesive piece of work however, owing to the vision of Petrucciani. The line-up is not awash with &quot;big names&quot; (although this doesn&#39;t mean much, there are all-star line-up albums that are absolute rotters) but there are two familiar names that do appear: Lenny White on the drums - best known for his fusion work. And on the last track a tasty guest soprano sax solo from Joe Lovano (Petrucciani later appears on Lovano&#39;s seminal &quot;From the Soul&quot; album which we covered a few weeks back). . It is hard to do an album like Music justice by just picking a few tunes to highlight. The album covers a lot of ground. At the start of this blog I embedded one of the most memorable pieces: &quot;My Bebop Tune&quot;. This is a crazy piece with a complicated stop-start melody with lots of twists and turns. It almost comes across as Michel mocking the ardent be-bop community for their obsession with needless complexity. I have always felt the tune is a little tongue in cheek, but others may disagree with me there. Either way it is a very cool piece that really shows off Petrucciani&#39;s chops as both a composer and player. . The highlight of the album is perhaps &quot;Lullaby&quot;. This is an absolutely beautiful piece full of the most delectable lines and a heartfelt presentation. Jazz artists often (wrongly) get accused of focussing only on the technical aspects of the music are incapable of portraying real emotion, if presented with that challenge one only needs to present &quot;Lullaby&quot; to make the argument null and void. I think you&#39;ll struggle to find a piece in any genre with more heart. . The final track &quot;Thinking of Wayne&quot; (below) features the Lovano guest solo part way through. This track is likely one of the more &quot;modern jazz&quot; sounding pieces on the album. Given some of the licks and compositional style I imagine this is a tribute to Wayne Shorter since this could have easily been a Shorter penned track on a Weather Report album. However I do not have anything to back this up as I no longer own a physical version of this album to check the liner notes. Regardless another very cool piece. . This is only a very small selection of what Music has to offer. You also have the Brazillian inspired &quot;Brazilian Suite No. 2&quot; and the Parisian &quot;Memories Of Paris&quot; featuring another guest Gil Goldstein on accordian. . In terms of &quot;rating&quot; I wouldn&#39;t quite place Music in the &quot;essential listening&quot; tier. It is a fantastic album that I always enjoy listening to but it is probably not quite an all-time classic. If you are already a fan of jazz and looking to expand your listening it is a good place to go to study Petrucciani&#39;s style. I think the music itself is quite approachable so it is worth listening to if this post has piqued your interest. .",

            "title": "Out There and Icon 8",
            "content": "This week marks another edition of the Plot Icon series. The coffees in this series are some of the most sort after, exciting and hard to get hold of coffees in the world - and so I&#39;m always looking forward to them. . This time the coffee is from Finca Guyubito located in Huila, Colombia - an area very well known to coffee nerds as many great coffees come from Huila. There are two aspects that make this coffee intriguing: firstly the cultivar is Java. This cultivar is well known for producing exceptional cup quality but also offers fairly good resistance to leaf rust and pests. World coffee research describes it as &quot;a good alternative to Gesha for small farmers&quot; due to these properties. . Then as with many of the Icon offerings we have an interesting processing method: namely a yeast fermentation. In this case yeast is added to the 36 hour fermentation step. Yeast addtions/fermentations are becoming increasingly popular in specialty coffee. They offer a reliable way to develop interesting coffee flavours. They are not without &quot;controversy&quot; however as some consider this &quot;cheating&quot; and you end up tasting the yeast rather than the coffee itself. I&#39;m more open to the idea personally and am interested to see how the trend develops. For me a good basic washed coffee will still be where my heart is however. . Let&#39;s dive straight into the coffee itself. As with the other Icon series this coffee was supplied in relatively small amounts so I&#39;m not going to play around with espresso - the blog is filter only this week! The dry aroma on the nose gives quite a delicate fragrance. I would describe it as a slightly tropical fruit scent with just an edge of funk. But there is also a soft roundness to it too almost like a marshmallow quality. It does not give you a big hit around the face with aroma but it is certainly intriguing and inviting. . This week also marks the first time in around 18 months I&#39;ve been able to locate my favoured Chemex filter papers (also via Plot). It has been very difficult to find these for a reasonable price during these times (I heard it was due to a paper shortage from so many disposable face masks being manufactured but that could just be a rumour). So brewing this coffee via the chemex paper the first thing I notice is the tropical fruit note. I would describe it more as melon, watermelon, mango, lychee and so on as opposed to the more acidic passionfruit style tropical notes. This gives way to a slight funk, but it is far from a funky-bus coffee - in fact the cup has a lot of the &quot;washed&quot; clarity which makes it very interesting. The mouthfeel is fairly creamy and heavy, more so than you&#39;d expect from a sweet, fruit forward coffee such as this. The aftertaste is clean but fairly long lived and has a &quot;moreish&quot; sort of quality that makes you want to come back and take another sip. . This is another top quality coffee from the Icon series (and I would expect nothing less). It is one that rewards those who put the effort in to identify all the flavours. And real appreciation comes from studying the complexities, if you&#39;re looking for an easy daily drinker you might not get the most from it. . For our classic jazz this week we&#39;re getting a bit free heading back to 1961 with Eric Dolphy&#39;s second release &quot;Out There&quot;. . . Dolphy had a career tragically cut short at the age of 36 due to undiagnosed diabetes. He has left us with countless gems in his back catalogue however. He is perhaps best known for his collaborative work with Charles Mingus and he appeared on many classic releases such as &quot;Mingus at Antibes&quot;, &quot;Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus&quot;, &quot;Pre Bird&quot; and &quot;Charles Mingus presents Charles Mingus&quot;. He also appeared on some Coltrane records most notably &quot;Africa Brass&quot; and &quot;Live at the Village Vanguard&quot;. Regular readers may also remember the name from Oliver Nelson&#39;s &quot;Blues and Abstract Truth&quot; and Andrew Hill&#39;s &quot;Point of Departure&quot;. For a recorded career spanning little more than 5 years Eric appeared on many of the classic recordings of the era. Here we look at Dolphy as a band leader however. During his lifetime he released 5 studio recordings and 2 live works, here we take a look at &quot;Out There&quot; his second recording and possibly my favourite in his back catalogue. His most famous release is undoubtedly &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; released posthumously on the Blue Note label, while I love this album (I&#39;m sure it will feature on this blog eventually) I find myself reaching for &quot;Out There&quot; more often. As these names suggest we&#39;re looking at &quot;outside&quot; and free styles of jazz here, as a statement &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; certainly takes us further out of our comfort zone - but &quot;Out There&quot; manages to seemlessly combine the inside and outside elements. This is a quality I&#39;m always drawn to. . Another aspect that makes &quot;Out There&quot; so intriguing is the instrumentation: . Eric Dolphy — alto saxophone, bass clarinet, B-flat clarinet, flute | Ron Carter — cello | George Duvivier — bass | Roy Haynes — drums | . The inclusion of two &quot;bass&quot; instruments is a masterstroke. Since there are no &quot;chord instruments&quot; it completely frees up both space in the mix and means Eric is not tied down harmonically. He has completely free reign to play as outside as he likes and allows him to resolve ideas in ways that are much more difficult with a fuller band behind him. It is hard to imagine how audiences would have reacted to this back then, at this point they would have heard Ornette and some of the early free jazz movement but for me Dolphy is far more surprising and even today (60 years later!) his music is challenging and fresh. . It is also worth taking a moment to give a shout out to Carter&#39;s cello playing. He is best known as a bassist and if you&#39;ve read this blog for any amount of time you&#39;ll see he pops up just about everywhere. You don&#39;t often hear him on cello (nor do you hear much cello in jazz generally) but his playing on &quot;Out There&quot; (especially the down tempo pieces) is one of the reasons the album is so memorable. . I would break &quot;Out There&quot; down into two halves: you have the uptempo numbers (for example the title track embedded at the start of this post and &quot;17 West&quot; embeded at the end) which take a bit of a nod towards the be-bop and post-bop movements but interprets them through the lens of free jazz. The music pulls you from the comfortable feeling of be-bop through to phrases so outside they feel like they&#39;re from outer-space. . The other half of the music on show is much more down-tempo in nature but no less experimental or free. One such example is the piece &quot;Eclipse&quot; (above) which was co-written by Charles Mingus. This is perhaps the most daring piece on the album taking an almost classical approach to composition. The strings form a rich sophisticated supporting landscape to Dolphy&#39;s melody, you can almost view it as a free-jazz update to the Duke Ellington compositional style. As the piece elegantly moves along Carter takes more and more liberties and plays some beautiful &quot;supporting solos&quot; to Dolphy&#39;s lines, it is a piece of detail you might not necessarily appreciate until a second or subsequent listen through the piece. . As with all my Icon series posts I consider this album to be &quot;essential listening&quot; - both from a historical significance and music appreciation perspective. If you come from a be-bop or post-bop background and would like to take some first steps towards free-jazz there are much worse places to start. Or perhaps you have had a small taste of free-jazz and have yet to hear Dolphy in action. Even if you&#39;re a life-long Dolphy stan, it&#39;s still worth giving &quot;Out There&quot; another listen. .",

            "title": "Last Chance Disco and Summer Claude",
            "content": "This week we&#39;re heading back to a favourite roaster of mine: Round Hill Roastery located in Bath, England. Round Hill have been around for a long time (in terms of specialty coffee in the UK) and I consider them one of the most reliable roasters around. The pricing is fair and the coffee top quality, they tend not to deal in &quot;unobtainium&quot; coffees. Instead they focus on more &quot;every day&quot; coffees that still taste fantastic. . The coffee this week is a &quot;limited edition&quot; offering from Round Hill and is called &quot;Summer Claude&quot;. Long time readers may remember &quot;Spring Claude&quot; appearing on the blog previously, but for those that are newer readers: Monsieur Claude ( https://www.instagram.com/monsieur_claude/ ) is a cat who every now and again selects the best coffees to be released under his name. I&#39;ve had most of the Claude offerings (perhaps even all of them?) and they don&#39;t disappoint. . . The coffee selected for the summer offering is a washed Ethiopian from the Nano Challa washing station. This is a very popular coffee and one that I have tried many (many) times in the past. This is the first time I have seen or bought it in 2021 however, and so one I have been looking forward to. . Let&#39;s dive right into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I get the &quot;typical&quot; bouquet of a washed Ethiopian - full of florals and stone fruits a-plenty. There is also a bit of a honey or caramel vibe to it too, but the immediate hit is from heady floral notes. These are the sort of aromas that get me excited to try the coffee itself. . As a filter made in the usual way the floral and stone-fruit combo is really evident. The cup is complex and you get the &quot;peach-iced tea laced with jasmine&quot; vibe that you get from washed Ethiopians. This one is fairly &quot;intense&quot; compared to others, sometimes these sorts of coffees can be really delicate whereas Summer Claude packs a bit of a punch. As one would expect the mouthfeel and body is fairly low, the sweetness and acidity are both fairly high. The aftertaste is clean but lingering (quite a nice combination). As with many complex cups this one is sensitive to cup temperature and it takes you on a journey as the cup cools, but not in a way that grabs your attention - it is perfect for those moments when you &quot;just want a cup&quot; while doing something else. . Moving onto the espresso side of things. As always I went for the filter roasted option (you can also get an espresso roast option) - as this is my preference for espresso. My comments might not translate to the espresso roast option. Dialing in this coffee was interesting, it is fairly forgiving but what was immediately apparent was Summer Claude likes longer pulls. In the end I settled for about a 10-15s preinfuse followed by a 36-38s pull for a 1:2 ratio. This is unheard of for me and I rarely get anywhere near to these times. Claude could take this sort of punishment however and was better for it. The mouthfeel and body was improved and there wasn&#39;t a hint of bitter/overextraction. The shot becomes essentially a very concentrated version of the filter, these was still flavour separation but also a lot of intensity. A really fun shot of espresso. . Overall another killer offering from Claude and Round Hill, just a very good example of a washed Ethiopian. I&#39;ll look forward to the next Claude! . On the jazz side this week I found myself dusting off an album from 2005 - the second recording of the Acoustic Ladyland group &quot;Last Chance Disco&quot;. . . Let&#39;s step back to the mid 2000s for a moment. There were a few jazz trends going on around the world, you had the jazz-funk-avant sound of Medeski Martin and Wood (and those they influenced) still going strong and in Europe you had the Esbjorn Svensson Trio (and the millions of copy cat acts). In the UK however we had a bit of a trend in the form of &quot;Jazz-Punk&quot;. One of the best acts in that genre (in my opinion at least) were Acoustic Ladyland. The band consisted of British musicians: . Pete Wareham – saxophones | Tom Cawley – keyboards | Tom Herbert – bass | Sebastian Rochford – drums | . As you would guess by the name: Acoustic Ladyland started off interpreting the music of Jimi Hendrix (on acoustic instruments). By &quot;Last Chance Disco&quot; (about 3-4 years after their debut) they went to electric instruments and began writing their own music. Founder Pete Wareham describes the inspiration for the album being his &quot;frustration with jazz and desire to infuse the ethic and fun of punk&quot;. My memory of the timelines are a little hazy but it is certainly one of the first albums I remember taking on the &quot;Jazz-Punk&quot; label which was later picked up by bands like &quot;(Get) The Blessing&quot; and &quot;Led Bib&quot; amongst others. . As you would expect from the &quot;punk&quot; label, a large focus of the music is on energy and attitude. This is not an album to pick up if you&#39;re after refined and elegant harmony - instead it&#39;s perhaps closer to instrumental rock music in its conception. The majority of the tunes are built around relatively simple melodies that act as the hook. These are usually built around rather simple chord changes and progressions and the interest comes from the change in dynamics, timing and all out aggression. . One of the highlights of &quot;Last Chance Disco&quot; (and other Acoustic Ladyland recordings) is the inclusion of drummer Seb Rochford. We have talked about Seb briefly in the Sons of Kemet blog post. His drumming style is unique and is generally quite easy to spot. While many jazz drummers are what I would call &quot;cymbal focussed&quot;, Seb tends to work the toms more and brings in influences and beats you might be more likely to hear in world music by the way of death metal. I also got to meet Seb at a gig before and he&#39;s a thoroughly nice chap to boot. . Usually at this point I like to disect some of the tracks on the album a little bit to talk about what makes them great, that doesn&#39;t really feel in the punk spirit of Acoustic Ladyland so I have instead embedded a few choice tracks and let the attitude and vibe speak for itself. I have tried to make picks that highlight the breadth of what&#39;s on offer: from the heavy-metal carnage of &quot;Iggy&quot; (at the start of this post). Through to the funk and noise-rock oddity of &quot;Of You&quot; (above). And the anthemic closing track &quot;Nico&quot; (below) which became a bit of a signature track for the band. While &quot;Last Chance Disco&quot; might not quite be worthy of &quot;essential listening&quot; status, it sure is a fun listen and is certainly &quot;of a time&quot;. This was music best enjoyed live though (preferably at a small, sweaty &quot;rock&quot; type venue with a party atmosphere). I&#39;m not sure if the &quot;jazz-punk&quot; thing made it out of the UK, it was a very short-lived trend amongst UK based bands. I&#39;d be interested to hear from any European of Transatlantic readers whether jazz-punk found its way to your shores. .",

            "title": "Solo Guitar and Ana Sora",
            "content": "For the past month or so this blog has focussed on either: unobtainium coffees, wild processing methods and roasters from all around the globe. This week we head back to some &quot;normality&quot; with a more &quot;everyday&quot; coffee. The roaster in question is our old friend Plot Roasting from Woolwich, London. . The coffee itself is from Ethiopia from a farm called Ana Sora located in Guji, Oromia. This is quite a popular producer and the coffees tend to be talked about fondly, many people calling it their favourite producer. The farm is owned by Israel Degfa who we have talked about on this blog in the past. As a re-cap, Israel owns many farms throughout Eithopia (mostly in the Oromia region) and supports local farmers and communities by offering financing, investing in healthcare, education and others. . As with many Ethiopian coffees the cultivar breakdown is not well understood and this coffee is simply listed as &quot;heirloom&quot; - a catch-all phrase for &quot;who knows?&quot;. This coffee has been naturally processed but there is not much info to be found on the exact processing undertaken. The altitude of this coffee is worthy of note being 1900-2350 masl - this is very high, which causes coffee to grow more slowly. The theory being that the slower growing leads to a more complex cup profile (although I am a little sceptical about this and haven&#39;t found altitude to be a good predictor). . Let&#39;s dive right into the coffee itself. On the dry aroma I get the delicate floral notes one would expect from a Guji. Combined of course with the stone fruit qualities present in pretty much all Ethiopian coffee. On the nose it is not a &quot;flavour bomb&quot; but it is certainly inviting. Brewed as a filter in the usual way: the notes from the nose carry over. You get the typical apricot and peach iced tea notes as expected, but these give way to floral violet and lavendar notes in the finish. It is not the most perfumed example I&#39;ve ever tasted but it is still a complex cup. Overall the balance is in favour of sweetness compared to acidity, most likely due to the natural processing of this coffee. In terms of body and mouthfeel I&#39;d describe it as a medium and the aftertaste is fairly long lived but reasonably clean. While being a natural it isn&#39;t a &quot;strong natural&quot; and manages to retain quite a lot of clarity. . In espresso I find this coffee really shines. All the flavour notes mentioned previously just get intesified - so you essentially end up with a concentrated apricot syrup flavoured with violets! I found this coffee can tolerate shorter ratios and I ended up dialing in to around 1:2.1-ish in around 27s - so a fairly typical profile. The roast level is quite light so the coffee works nicely in longer/much longer ratios too but in a more concentrated form I find the mouthfeel more appealling. It is a very forgiving coffee in as much as you can play with ratio/time at will, however I found that small grinder adjustments made a big difference so it might not be great for those with stepped grinders. Temperature wise I kept the machine at full whack owing to roast (this is intended as a filter roast). . All in all a solid &quot;everyday&quot; coffee and a good example of what to expect from a Guji natural. . On the jazz side this week we are taking a look at one of my guitar heros: Ted Greene with his 1977 release &quot;Solo Guitar&quot;. . . Ted Greene may be a new name to anybody who is not a guitarist (and even to many guitarists too). He was never a &quot;big&quot; name, and in fact &quot;Solo Guitar&quot; represents his only studio recording. Outside of this album there are only a few low resolution videos and recordings dotted around the internet of him. One may ask: how can somebody like this become a guitar-hero for many jazz guitarists? The first answer to this is: listen to Solo Guitar! But another answer is: Ted&#39;s biggest passion was jazz education. He has given us guitarists a treasure trove of lessons, transcriptions and ideas to work with. He reportedly said he didn&#39;t enjoy playing live music or recording as it made him nervous, but he was perfectly happy teaching a room full of people all about jazz guitar. So what makes Ted&#39;s playing so special? You may be asking, it is his knowledge of chords and harmony. Dire Straits may have said: &quot;Check guitar George, he knows all the chords&quot; - really they should have been talking about Ted Greene. He came up with so many beautiful chord voicings and in his arrangements he often interchanged the voicings at will - some close interval, some wide interval, some voicings you never hear elsewhere. His approach to doing this was totally unique and you can tell when people are &quot;doing Ted&quot; in their playing, but very few manage to pull it off convincingly (Tim Lerch is one in the Ted Greene style who has managed to incorporate Ted&#39;s ideas in a natural way). . Ted had many other far influencing ideas beyond harmony: he is (to my knowledge) one of the first jazz guitarists to use a telecaster - something later popularised by Frisell, Stern and others. He also made use of the harp-harmonic techniques, again something not that popular when he was doing it. Perhaps the biggest of his influences was his use of &quot;neck vibrato&quot; in jazz guitar. This is where you hold the body of the guitar against you and push/pull the neck to gently apply vibrato to the notes. This has become a staple for other jazz guitarists, perhaps most notably Bill Frisell who uses this technique frequently. . &quot;Solo Guitar&quot; as an album, as the name suggests, focusses on solo guitar arrangements. Each tune is a standard or &quot;pop&quot; tune and so the music should be somewhat familiar anybody listening. Of course the magic is in the arrangment, these are not typical jazz guitar arrangements. There is a certain elegance and beauty to what is being played. Many guitarists (jazz or otherwise) fall into the trap of making music that appeals only to guitarists but with Ted I feel there&#39;s a lot to appeal to a much wider audience. It is a shame that he didn&#39;t leave us with a much wider range of recordings. . Picking a few select tracks from the album is difficult as there&#39;s something to be taken from each arrangement. One of the tracks I particularly enjoy is &quot;Danny Boy&quot; (embedded at the start of this post), the intro to the track shows off Ted&#39;s creative use of harp-harmonics to extend out chord voicings and shows off that enviable knowledge of harmony. . Another favourite track would be &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; (above). Through the use of creative voicings he manages to take a tune that can often end up sounding a bit &quot;dull&quot; and breathes new life into it. Continuing the theme of potentially &quot;dull&quot; tunes is &quot;Ol&#39; Man River&quot; (below) - what is particularly interesting about this one is the use of his time, he goes between periods of straight and swing and gently undulates between the two at will, often while changing tempo or feel. . I would hesitate to call &quot;Solo Guitar&quot; an &quot;essential&quot; album for a jazz record collection, the arrangements are terrific and inspiring but it is more of a &quot;musician&#39;s album&quot; than one for a general jazz fan. You also have to put up with less than ideal recording quality. But it is well worth giving it a listen and I think it is certainly one of the more interesting solo jazz-guitar records out there. .",

            "title": "Weather Report and Fuglen",
            "content": "This week we have another instalment of my KaffeBox subscription - this time featuring coffee from: Fuglen Coffee Roasters, located in Oslo, Norway. This is the first time I&#39;ve even heard of these guys and girls, part of the joy of a subscription such as this, and so one I was looking forward to. . The first thing I want to note is the aesthetic of the coffee bags: they are very much my style. Each bag features a rather funky artwork, an example is below (taken from their webstore: https://www.fuglencoffee.no/ ) . . Each artwork features a depiction of a bird - and after some google translating I now know that &quot;fuglen&quot; is &quot;the bird&quot; in Norwegian. Apart from the artwork the bags are pretty sparse with just the basic information you need: origin, produers, region, varietals, processing and roast date. I appreciate this approach, simple and to the point. Also plus points for using coffee bags that are easily recyclable. . As you may recall as part of my subscription I receive 2 small bags (125g) of coffee - to allow me to dial in effectively I dedicate one to filter and one to espresso. This week I received a Kenyan and a Colombian coffee and I typically do not favour Kenyan coffee as espresso so that one was dedicated to filter duty. . Let&#39;s start on the filter side: the Kenyan coffee is from the Kiambu County and produced by the Ndumberi Farmer coop. The stated cultivars are: SL-34, Ruiru-11, Batian and SL-28 (Peaberry). For those unaware: a peaberry is a mutation where each coffee cherry contains only 1 seed (&quot;bean&quot;) rather than 2 seperated by mucilage. Peaberries are very easy to identify visually as the beans will be &quot;rounded&quot; instead of having 1 flat side. It was/is believed that peaberry coffees taste better and so command a higher price, this is not something I&#39;ve particularly noticed in the past so I tend not to search out peaberries specifically. . Onto the coffee itself: the coffee is roasted a touch darker (visually) than one might expect from a &quot;nordic&quot; (but it is by no means &quot;dark&quot;). On the dry aroma you get the normal washed Kenyan profile: a very strong hit of blackcurrants. On aroma alone it is hard to get much more from it. Once it has been brewed again the predominant note is blackcurrant - as you would expect. Alongside are a supporting cast of rhubarb, orange, pink grapefruit and melon. Overall a very solid example of a washed Kenyan coffee. The acidity level is noticable but not overbearing, the sweetness is medium-low - just enough to take the edge off the acidity. If you like Kenyan coffees you&#39;ll like this one a lot. . On the espresso side we have a Colombian coffee from Tarqui, Huila. The farm in question is called Finca El Prado and the producer is Ferney Cruz Trujillo. The coffee has been washed and the cultivar is Caturra. In terms of dialing in the settings from the previous espresso I was running were nearly perfect so there was little for me to tweak and so I can&#39;t comment on how hard this one is to dial in. I found a ratio of 1:2.25 to work well in around 25s all in. This gave just enough mouthfeel but allowed the flavour notes to be adequately separated. The main notes for me were stone fruits along with a grapefruit acidity. It was not the most complex shot of espresso I ever had but it was very drinkable and highly enjoyable. I would describe it as a medium for acidity, sweetness and body - it&#39;s just the sort of coffee you can really enjoy. If I had to pick between the two coffees I&#39;d say this one is my favourite of the pair, it just hit the spot. . On the jazz side this week I dug out a bit of an overlooked record from a band that is not at all overlooked: the 1982 self-titled &quot;Weather Report&quot;. . . In a move that confused record collectors and record shops alike, in 1982 Weather Report released their 10th studio album &quot;Weather Report&quot; - which shared a title with their 1971 debut album. I think this confusion led to this album being slightly overlooked in the Weather Report back catalogue, which is unfortunate as it is a great album. This is the second Weather Report album I ever owned - I remember purchasing the classic &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; on CD and loving it. Shortly after I found a vinyl copy of &quot;Weather Report&quot; (1982) in a second hand record store for very little money so I snapped it up without really knowing much about it. It is probably worth going into a little band history to put this album into context: the fusion super-group was formed/co-led by keyboard/pianist Joe Zawinul and saxophonist Wayne Shorter, who had previously worked together on Miles Davis&#39; &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;. The band has had many other musicians pass through the ranks but by far the most successful/popular line-ups feature the great Jaco Pastorius on the bass and Peter Erskine on the drums. &quot;Weather Report&quot; (1982) is the last album to feature this classic line-up. . The music itself has a kind of &quot;end of an era&quot; feel to it also - the collaborative efforts on previous albums make way for some of Joe Zawinul&#39;s more ambitious arrangements. The album feels a bit like a cross-over between Weather Report and The Zawinul Syndicate (Joe&#39;s next project). Jaco in particular seems to take a back seat on &quot;Weather Report&quot; - his only writing credit is in the concluding extended jam and he doesn&#39;t really take the limelight with any memorable basslines on this one. Many of his basslines are doubled by Zawinul&#39;s synths - something which angered Jaco and led him to a more &quot;acoustic&quot; direction in his following solo career. The album is therefore one for the Zawinul fans (of which I am certainly one). . The album kicks off in style with the grooving &quot;Volcano For Hire&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog post). This could have featured on just about any of the &quot;classic&quot; Weather Report recordings and not felt out of place. It highlights Erskine&#39;s unique drum grooves (supported by percussionist Robert Thomas Jr.), Zawinul&#39;s compositional voice and moments of magic from Jaco and Wayne. The tune has a nod to the &quot;world music&quot; style that Weather Report and Zawinul in particular were known for. . The most ambitious tune on the album is likely the 3 movement &quot;NYC&quot; suite (above). The piece is probably the most &quot;swinging&quot; on the album with Zawinul experimenting with the tonal and harmonic possibilities of his synths. There are many twists and turns throughout the piece and it keeps you on your toes and continually surprises. It is probably the most &quot;Syndicate&quot;-ish tune on the album and an interesting piece of history to see where Zawinul was heading. . The album concludes with the jam &quot;Dara Factor Two&quot; (below) - this is the only piece on the album that has writing credits from all band members (elsewhere on the album Shorter has one writing credit for &quot;When It Was Now&quot; with Zawinul picking up all other credits). The collaborative nature of this piece gives it a very different feeling to the rest of the album and it shows what great improvisers were in this band - it acts as a fitting send off for this incarnation of Weather Report. . Due to it&#39;s lack of commercial success I wouldn&#39;t place this in the &quot;essential listening&quot; category (like say &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; or &quot;Black Market&quot;) but for Weather Report fans (or fans of fusion in general) it is worth checking out if it is a record you have overlooked. .",

            "title": "Africa Brass and Icon 7",
            "content": "This week we have another coffee in the Icon series from the folks at Plot Coffee Roasting. This time we have an origin I rarely go for: Brazil. The stereotypes for Brazilian coffees are &quot;chocolatey&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot;, &quot;nutty&quot; and so on. These are not flavour notes I tend to favour. As you&#39;d expect from an &quot;unobtainium&quot; coffee in the Icon series, this is not a typical coffee from Brazil. . The coffee is from Daterra Coffee, located in Cerrado - the first &quot;A&quot; grade rainforest certified farm. Within Daterra coffee there is the &quot;Masterpiece Farm&quot; from which this particular lot was grown. Masterpiece is a dedicated research facility looking into the latest and greatest cultivars, processing methods and so on. Each lot is very small and they often achieve cup scores in excess of 90 (i.e. very good!). . This particular coffee is a Aramosa cultivar - this is a &quot;pre-cultivar&quot; as its genetics are still being studied. Needless to say you don&#39;t see these very often and it is a first for me. The Aramosa is a cross between Arabica coffee and Racemosa coffee species. Nearly all the coffees on this blog are Arabica, Racemosa is harder to find - it brings with it naturally low caffeine and is drought and disease resistant. This is important for the future of coffee and so it is very interesting to see what happens with these latest &quot;cross&quot; cultivars. . In addition to the cultivar this coffee is also an anaerobic processed lot. We have spoken about anaerobic processing in the past - the removal of oxygen in the fermentation process allows for different flavour compounds to develop. This coffee is therefore a full-house in the game of &quot;high end coffee bingo&quot;. . None of this fanciness means a thing unless the coffee tastes good however, so lets move onto the important stuff. As always with these Icon coffees the amounts are too low to reliably dial in espresso and taste as filter so this blog post is a filter coffee only post (normal espresso service to resume next week). . On the dry aroma I get a very interesting profile, it is immediately recognisable as something different. I would describe it as sweet like, but old-fashioned sweets like parma violets, love hearts, etc. Quite a &quot;soft&quot; profile and almost a powder-y floralness to them. But there is also a bit of tropical funk there too but it is very restrained. . In the cup the first thing to notice is a complete lack of bitterness. The coffees we feature on this blog are typically not bitter to begin with, but this is a noticable step down. I can only presume it is the reduced caffeine levels. I would describe this as a soft and delicate coffee, it is one that only gives up its flavours when you really look for them. The cup itself is very complex, there are a lot of florals packed in there. Alongside is the powder-y sherbet-type sweetness we got off the nose. I also notice a feint aniseed note when the cup reaches just the right temperature too. In terms of fruity notes it has some tropical notes there along with your stone fruits. The sweetness level is high and the mouthfeel gives the impression of stickyness. . This is a very interesting cup, it is hard to describe because it is different to most other coffees I drink. It is one you really have to try for yourself to appreciate it. Yet again Plot manage to surprise with their Icon series, as always I look forward to see what the next month brings. . As is customary on Icon coffee posts I pick a jazz icon to pair with it. Amazingly it has taken 64 blog posts for this musician to appear: welcome to the blog John Coltrane. We take a look at his 1961 studio release &quot;Africa/Brass&quot;. . . In terms of &quot;classic&quot; Coltrane recordings &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; might seem an &quot;odd&quot; first choice for the blog. While it is perhaps less well known than some of the other more successful recordings &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; is one of my favourite Coltrane recordings. I&#39;m going to say something controversial here: but I don&#39;t particularly enjoy many of Coltranes albums under his own name. The ones that are good are fantastic, but I feel there is a lot of filler too and I&#39;m not a fan of &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; or any of the &quot;spiritual&quot; albums that followed. I can only assume my membership to the jazz-bloggers union is going to be quickly revoked after posting such heresy. . &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; was released on Impulse records - now a legendary record label, but &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; marks only the 6th release on Impulse. This was quite a bold move by the label all things considered. While Coltrane was a big name after hits such as the impressive &quot;Giant Steps&quot; and &quot;Blue Train&quot; which earned him the reputation of being an all time great - &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; strayed quite far from the Coltrane formula through the addition of a big-band orchestra. As if the 21 piece big-band wasn&#39;t strange enough even the instrumentation is quite weird through the use of french horns and euphoniums. This is quite a big risk for a fledgling label when they could have just churned out a &quot;cutting date&quot; with the Coltrane band and sold a lot of units. I&#39;m glad they took the risk however, as &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; is really a special album. . The album consists of just 3 tracks (modern reissues feature many more) and spans just 33 minutes in length (perhaps the one downside of the album). There are two Coltrane originals &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Blues Minor&quot; along with a reworking of &quot;Greensleeves&quot;. The orchestration comes courtesy of pianist and long-time collaborator McCoy Tyner and (perhaps a bit left-field) Eric Dolphy. The Dolphy connection perhaps adds to some of the &quot;weirdness&quot; in the orchestration, but it certainly adds to the experience. . With such long track lengths there is of course ample opportunity for extended soloing as you&#39;d expect from a Coltrane record. John is on top form throughout his earlier &quot;sheets of sound&quot; firebreathing is still there but this is paired with the modal playing that dominated his later recordings. For me he catches just the right balance between the two. The contrast with the big band is also fascinating. I am also a huge fan of Coltrane on Soprano, I think he is if anything underated on this instrument as all the focus tends to be on his tenor magic. . Although this is a big band record, the core of the album is still the Coltrane Quartet. At this time consisting of: . John Coltrane – soprano and tenor saxophone | McCoy Tyner – piano | Reggie Workman – bass | Elvin Jones – drums | . On the album McCoy does McCoy things and he is instantly recognisable. He is such a huge part of the Coltrane sound of this era. He provides the &quot;dream like&quot; feel that allows John to really express himself. And of course he is no slouch himself, providing some killer piano solos throughout. Then of course we have the core of any band, the drummer. In this case Elvin Jones keeps things grooving and drives the music forward. For me one of the greatest drummers of all time. His voice is totally unique and again adds to the Coltrane sound. . With so few tracks it is hard to talk about &quot;top tracks&quot; so I have just embedded side 2 of the album in this post. To really appreciate this album, however, you should really listen from start to finish. I would recommend sticking to the &quot;original&quot; track listing rather than the extended re-issues as I don&#39;t think they add anything to the experience and really are just for the completist. If you have not heard &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; before you should definitely hunt down a copy, and if you have heard it before maybe it&#39;s time to give it another spin? As with many albums on this blog it is in the &quot;must listen&quot; category and well worth investing the time in. .",

            "content": "For a bit of a change of pace on the blog this week we have a brand new roaster (to this blog): Sey Coffee ( https://www.seycoffee.com/ ) from Brooklyn, NY. This is a roaster I have never sampled from before, importing coffee from the US is always problematic for those of us this side of the Atlantic. The shipping is often highly unpredictable and expensive, that fancy lot you were desperate to try could turn up months late (or not at all). Fortunately, Prufrock Coffee in London ( https://prufrockcoffee.com/ ) have started a webstore and so we have access to some interesting roasters from all over the world with very little inconvenience. . Sey have been on my &quot;to try&quot; list for quite a while and so I was happy to see their coffees become available. I already had to many bags of coffee so unfortunately I could only warrant a single bag to try. This of course raised the difficult question: which to try? Of the four or so on offer I opted for the Colombian &quot;La Luna&quot;, the selection criteria was fairly simple: it all came down to cultivar. This coffee is a 100% Pacamara lot. Pacamara is a cultivar that has very low yields and is extremely susceptible to pests/disease but has exceptional cup quality. It is one of my favourite cultivars but you do not see it very often. The coffee itself has undergone a pulped natural processing. . Diving straight in to the coffee itself. On the dry aroma: I&#39;m getting honey and floral notes mostly but there is a feint fruity note in the background. It is not a particualrly &quot;loud&quot; coffee on the nose but it is certainly very appealling. Upon opening the bag for the first time I actually said: &quot;oh wow&quot; out loud. . As a filter coffee things start to get interesting. The coffee has a sugar-y sort of sweetness to it, an almost candyfloss type of vibe. However there is a floral lavendar type of note (although I may be specifying lavendar because the packaging is purple). As the cup cools the florals become more present and they are particularly noticable in the finish. The fruit notes on the nose are also present, I would describe them as a raspberry sharpness. The bag mentions tropical notes, and while I can notice them I&#39;m not sure I would have gone for that as a descriptor without being prompted. The cup itself is very clean and the sharp acidity helps with this. The body and mouthfeel are pretty low, for me this is not problem but for those enjoying the chewier bigger coffees this might be a little thin for your tastes. . Onto the espresso now: this one was remarkably easy to work with, it just requires a fine grind. If you want to make something approaching a ristretto out of this coffee you&#39;ll need a truly top end grinder - I could just about get a 1:2 out of it with my grinder on the edge of chirp. Given the relatively low body of this coffee however there isn&#39;t any harm in going a bit longer and my preference was a 1:2.75 ratio - this allowed some of the floral notes in the aftertaste to still be present. Going shorter and the cup became a bit more 1 dimensional (although still delicious). The flavour profile in the espresso is similar to the filter but more concentrated: the candyfloss sweetness is perhaps more like a caramel or honey and the raspberry note is a bit more prominent at the expense of the lavendar. . Overall a kick-ass coffee from Sey, I&#39;m glad I got to finally try some of their coffee and I&#39;ll be on the lookout for them again. . For the jazz this week I found myself digging out an old Scofield record from 1990: &quot;Time on my Hands&quot;. . . &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; is a one of the first vinyl records I ever bought. I remember purchasing it quite clearly, at the time I was fairly new to jazz and still exploring. I already owned two of Sco&#39;s albums (&quot;A Go Go&quot; and &quot;Uberjam&quot;) which I had on CD which I really enjoyed but I hadn&#39;t heard anything else from him. &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; was a really pleasant surprise, it was totally different to the other Sco albums I had heard at that point and probably more &quot;traditional&quot;, it kicked off a bit of a Sco obsession for me. . &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; is interesting for a number of reasons: firstly it is John&#39;s first record on Blue Note which has some cachet in of itself. But it is also a &quot;super-group&quot; type recording with an all-star cast of musicians: . John Scofield - guitar | Joe Lovano - saxophone | Charlie Haden - bass | Jack DeJohnette - drums With a lineup like this there is very little to go wrong! &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; is also the first recording with Sco and Lovano appearing together (to my knowledge) - and so the start of a successful partnership that produced many great records during the 90s. I believe this is what lifts &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; above other Sco records of the same era, while Sco&#39;s playing is always top-notch, the addition of Lovano seems to push Sco compositionally. The tunes on the album are much more recognisable and interesting than any on the previous Gramavision records. The interplay between John and Joe is also a joy to listen to. | . Listening back to the album in 2021, things do sound a little dated however. The production itself has a very &quot;80s&quot; feel to it. In addition this was when all jazz guitarists for some inexplicable reason decided that they should leave their chorus pedals on 24/7 (to be fair it was not just jazz guitarists, but they are some of the worst offenders). The result is a very dated sound which may be difficult for some to deal with. The sound does fit the music however, the chorus adds an almost faux-leslie vibe to the guitar sound. . I have listened to this album so many times over the years it is hard to pick out just a few tracks to talk about. One of the main strengths of the album is there is absolutely no filler, each tune is worthy of being there. This is in contrast to some of the prior Scofield records which have the odd fantastic tune but then some that don&#39;t quite live up. . One of my favourite tunes off the album is &quot;Flower Power&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). For me it really sums up John&#39;s compositional voice at the time, the theme is relatively simple but the way he plays with the timing is what really brings the piece alive. His lead playing shows off his &quot;laid-back&quot; approach that he further developed in later recordings. This is one of the few tracks where Joe Lovano does not appear however. . A track where John and Joe certainly work together, however, is &quot;Wabash III&quot; (embedded above). This is a reimagining of &quot;Wabash&quot; that appeared a couple of years earlier on his &quot;Loud Jazz&quot; album (if anybody knows what happened to &quot;Wabash II&quot; I&#39;d be very interested to hear!) Whereas the previous version had a rock snarl, &quot;Wabash III&quot; is much more sophisticated and very indicative of the 90s jazz movement towards more &quot;traditional&quot; sounds. The John/Joe interplay on this track is certainly one of the highlights of the album and you can see why they continued to collaborate. I also love Joe&#39;s solo on this track and I have stolen a number of licks from it. . My last pick is the closing track &quot;Fat Lip&quot; (embedded below). It&#39;s a tune with groove, swagger and rock attitude but also some sophistication. The sophistication of the compositions is a common theme throughout the album in general, the ideas are quite clever but they are done in a natural way and they are not thrown in your face in a &quot;look how clever I am&quot; way - I think this is why you can keep coming back to this album many years later. For the Scofield nerds out there: you can also hear the theme from &quot;I Don&#39;t Need No Doctor&quot; off his Ray Charles tribute album (and a riff John Mayer pinched for his own cover also). . If you are a fan of John Scofield, or jazz guitar in general, and you haven&#39;t picked up a copy of &quot;Time on my Hands&quot; you really should. The tone and production may be a bit dated now, but it is worth sticking with it - you will be handsomely rewarded for it. .",

            "title": "From the Soul and Finca Momoto",
            "content": "This week on the blog we are looking at another coffee from the folks at Crankhouse Coffee Roastery in Devon. You know you are in safe hands when purchasing from Crankhouse, they have a stellar reputation and for good reason. This time we have a rather special coffee called: &quot;Finca Momoto &#39;Beautiful Lot&#39;&quot;. . The coffee is from Panama and is a naturally processed Gesha cultivar. In of itself this is a reason to get excited, but in addition Finca Momoto is owned by Luis Miranda and Aliss Hartmann - the Hartmann name brings with a certain cachet in the coffee world. As you would expect this coffee is not exactly cheap, but all things considered I do not believe it is exorbitantly priced. In the recent past I bought 4 bags of coffee so terrible most of it had to be binned (to be clear not from Crankhouse, and the roasters in mention shall not be named) - so at the moment I do not mind paying a premium to get something I&#39;m confident I&#39;ll enjoy. . It is also worth noting Crankhouse have recently changed their packaging and this is the first coffee I received in these clothes: . . I think the design is a marked improvement from the previous design. I like the &quot;Um Bongo&quot; vibes the artwork has - and I should have really bought some Congolese coffee for the full effect! . But onto the coffee itself: the first thing to note is that this roast is light, I&#39;d go as far as to say very light. I have no problem with this but it&#39;s something to keep in mind. On the dry aroma I get a perfumed floral bouquet (as one would expect from a Gesha) it is fairly delicate and it doesn&#39;t blow you away with intensity. In addition there is a slight hint of tropical fruit notes but they&#39;re not immediately apparent. . As a filter, prepared in my usual way, the first thing I noted down was: &quot;Oh Jeez... Beautiful lot indeed&quot;. Which just about sums it up, this coffee has an extremely elegant beauty to it. If you&#39;re after absolutely huge flavour surprising flavour notes this is probably not for you. Instead if you want a really clean and elegant cup with high complexity this is one worth buying. The flavour notes are typically &quot;Gesha&quot; in nature: apricots, honeysuckle and jasmine are the main ones. There are some faint more tropical notes of mango and passionfruit along with wild strawberries that come out to play at certain cup temperatures. As with many complex coffees this one enjoys being slightly cooler than you&#39;d typically go. The acidity level is fairly low and the sweetness probably around a medium. The natural processing also seems to add some body and mouthfeel to the cup which is certainly enjoyable. . As an espresso you would expect this to be a pain to dial in given the roast level, and in a way it is and in a way it&#39;s not. It&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; to dial in, in the sense that it&#39;s hard to make a bad tasting shot owing to the lower acidity levels. However it is &quot;hard&quot; to dial in to perfection, I found even a 0.1g change in dose can have quite a marked effect. In the end I settled for a 1:2.55 ratio pulled in about 22s. Reasonably long but reasonably quick. Going longer added more complexity but this coffee has some mouthfeel so I didn&#39;t want to lose that entirely. Going shorter made it difficult to distinguish individual flavour notes. In terms of flavours I would describe it as a perfumed apricot syrup. A really beautiful shot of espresso, but some of the complexity gets lost at this concentration. . As I expected this coffee was a knockoout and one I&#39;ll miss. . On the jazz side this week I dug out a record from 1992: Joe Lovano&#39;s epic &quot;From the Soul&quot;. . . For me the early 90s represents a bit of a &quot;dead period&quot; for jazz. The synth-laden fusion sound of the 80s suddenly became seriously un-hip almost overnight (similar relationships with the synth exist in other musical genres too). The Jazz-Funk sound of MMW and the like had not taken off yet and so the period became a bit of a &quot;transition period&quot;. There were, however, a small group of musicians trying to push jazz back to a more &quot;traditional&quot; soundscape, and I consider Lovano to be one those at the forefront of that movement. Unfortunately many critics did not enjoy this, and in my opinion were unnecesarily harsh, claiming they were doing &quot;nothing new&quot;. &quot;From the Soul&quot; was one of the few albums that won over critics and fans alike during this period. Looking at the lineup on the album it&#39;s not hard to see why it was so highly regarded: . Joe Lovano — tenor, alto, &amp; soprano saxophones | Michel Petrucciani — piano | Dave Holland — bass | Ed Blackwell — drums | . Joe is, of course, a master of the saxophone. Now regarded as one of the &quot;elder statesmen&quot; of jazz and for me personifies the &quot;jazz musician&quot; stereotype more than anybody else (and I mean that as a complement). His gravelly voice and &quot;hip&quot; vocabulary just become an extension of his music. He still tours quite widely to this day (current global situation excluded) and is one of the best live acts around, someone I always try and see if he is in town. While many sax players look for a very fluid legato style, Joe often favours a more &quot;herky-jerky&quot; staccato style which provides a lot of interesting rhythmic development in his solos. On &quot;From the Soul&quot; you hear glimpses of that style but there&#39;s not quite as much of it as on his more recent recordings. On the album you can hear inspiration from the prior masters of the instrument: Coltrane, Rollins and Coleman but there is a freshness and energy to his playing. It is easy to see why this was a landmark recording for Lovano. . The inclusion of Michel Petrucciani is interesting, one of the greatest pianists of his generation without a doubt. On this record (his only recording with Joe I believe) he plays in a very different style to what you would expect. Here he plays sparse lines and gives the music space to breath, for the Pertucciani historians certianly an interesting record. . On the bass you have Dave Holland, one of my all-time favourite bass players. Another who is still touring heavily and well worth seeing live. I have a few stories about Dave&#39;s gigs but I&#39;ll save those until we feature one of Dave&#39;s albums. Here he just provides some great aggressive and hard hitting basslines and some unbelievable solos. Really all the musicians are on top form on this record. . As you&#39;d expect from the name &quot;From the Soul&quot; this record features a number of ballads, but this is combined with more uptempo and energetic numbers. One such example is the track &quot;Evolution&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). This is perhaps the most &quot;Lovano&quot; of all the tracks and nobody would have batted an eyelid if this appeared on one of his latest releases. Blackwell&#39;s drumming provides the power to drive the track forward and Holland&#39;s basslines provide enough elasticity for Lovano to push and pull the meter at his leisure. For me one of the album highlights on an album which is all &quot;highlight&quot;. . One of the standards on the record is the ballad &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (above) and with the slow tempo Joe shows why the album is called &quot;From the Soul&quot;. His tone is exquisite and he plays with just the right level of energy to keep things interesting while paying respect to the tune. When I think of the album this is instantly the track I think of. . If I had to pick a &quot;hit&quot; from the album I would likely pick &quot;Fort Worth&quot; (below). This is a track I have heard him play live multiple times and it always goes down well. It has the combination of having a good groove and an easily singable melody which is a surefire way to crafting a &quot;crowd favourite&quot;. Of course the playing is fantastic too which doesn&#39;t hurt. . Almost every week I describe an album as a &quot;must listen&quot; for those interested in jazz, but that is the nature of featuring only one record a week - I get to focus on the true gems. This album is certainly worthy of the &quot;must listen&quot; status - especially since both Joe and Dave are still touring heavily and so these are musicians you can still get a chance to see live (the best way to consume jazz). .",

            "title": "It's Mostly Residual and Diego Bermudez",
            "content": "This week we are sticking with the folks at Plot Roasting (far from their first appearance on this blog). In particular we are looking at their &quot;special edition&quot; coffee from Diego Bermudez. Diego, at this point, is a familiar name on this blog - his coffees have appeared multiple times in multiple different guises. He is widely regarded as one of the thought leaders of &quot;experimental processing&quot; and the quality in the cup speaks for itself. . The coffee this time is a Pink Bourbon cultivar. As you may recall from previous posts Pink Bourbon is a natural hybrid of Red and Yellow Bourbon cultivars. It has a very high cup quality but unfortunately it is quite hard to isolate and grow so it is much rarer than its red/yellow parents (and as such demands a premium). This particular coffee undergoes a stringent multistage process: . At picking 90% ripe and 10% semi-ripe cherries are selected | Cherries are washed with sterilised water | First aerobic fermentation for 42 hours, 17 celcius. Cherries are whole and without water | Second anaerobic fermentation 72 hours at 19 celcius. Cherries are whole and without water | Cherries de-pulped | 26 hours drying in 37 celcius air with 3% humidity until reaching grain humidity of 10-11% | Coffee stabilises in grainpro bags for 15 days | . As you would expect from Diego; this is intricate and very controlled processing. . Diving into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I am hit with feint tropical fruit notes, caramels and sweetness. For such a &quot;crazy&quot; processing the dry aroma is quite restrained, but still inviting. As a filter brew the coffee is anything but restrained however. The cup is extremely complex and bursting with fruitiness. Some of the flavour notes include: strawberry, watermelon, lychee, grape, rhubarb, redcurrant and more. One of the notes listed on the label is: &quot;watermelon jolly ranchers&quot; and I struggle to come up with a better descriptor than that. The sweetness level of this coffee is very high and the acidity is medium-high which helps offset. I would describe the sweetness as a &quot;boiled sweet&quot; type sweetness alongside the fruity notes. The mouthfeel and body are fairly low but there&#39;s enough there to keep it interesting. . As an espresso I find this coffee really shines, however. There is one small issue; the coffee requires an extremely fine grind. On my grinder I was just off chirp and could only get a 1:2.5 ratio consistently out of it - this is likely to be an espresso that would not perform too well without a quality grinder. Given the fine grind a lot of attention needs to be paid to puck prep, but as long as there&#39;s no obvious defect the shots are delicious and reasonably forgiving. The &quot;jolly ranchers&quot; tastenote from the filter gets amplified in its concetrated form and you have a sticky delicious boiled-sweet type shot. Personally a couldn&#39;t get enough of it (at time of writing I have enough for about 2 more shots left, I&#39;ll be sad to see it go). Some of the complexity of the filter cup is lost in the espresso but the punchiness and increased mouthfeel more than make up for it. . Unsurprisingly both Plot and Diego Bermudez come up with another great coffee. I&#39;m sure this will not be the last time they&#39;re featured here. . On the jazz side this week I dug out a record from 2006 - &quot;It&#39;s Mostly Residual&quot; by Cuong Vu. . . Cuong Vu is a Vietnamese-American trumpeter, he is best known for being part of the Pat Metheny Group during the early 00s - and this is certainly where I came across him, and why I picked up &quot;It&#39;s Mostly Residual&quot; back in 2006. While Pat Metheny Group records are, well, Pat Metheny-ish: Cuong&#39;s recordings take on a different vibe all together. He is more interested in textural soundscapes and he veers much further into the &quot;free&quot; side than you typically find on Metheny records. While I enjoy these sorts of explorations, many Metheny fans picking up a Vu record may be a little shocked and put off. It is perhaps for this reason that his albums maybe slightly overlooked. . On &quot;It&#39;s Mostly Residual&quot; we have a quartet of musicians: . Cuong Vu - trumpet | Stomu Takeishi - bass | Ted Poor - drums | Bill Frisell - guitar The first 3 members making up the &quot;Cuong Vu Trio&quot; who appear on many albums together, while guitarist Bill Frisell appears as a &quot;guest&quot; (for those interested in jazz guitar in 2016 there is also the &quot;Cuong Vu Trio Meets Pat Metheny&quot; which is interesting to compare the guitarists in identical setups). I make no apologies about being a huge Bill Frisell fan and Bill has appeared on the blog multiple times. On this album we have what I like to call &quot;Weird Bill&quot; - Bill has perhaps 3 main &quot;modes&quot; to work in: &quot;Country-influenced Bill&quot; is where most of his recent work lives, it is jazz fused with country/Americana. You then have &quot;Comping Bill&quot; where he accompanies other musicians and creates a soundscape to highlight their best qualities. Then you have &quot;Weird Bill&quot; where he plays really outside, uses lots of fuzz, feedback and noise. It is in complete contrast to his other modes which makes him so interesting as a musician. | . I saw Bill in London promoting one of his &quot;Country Bill&quot; albums once, I was sat in the front row and beside me was a group of Americans. They were extremely obnoxious and talked through a lot of the set and were generally quite disrespectful. Just before the interval Bill was playing a standard/pop-tune off the album he was promoting - but at the end you could see the Bill smirk come out so you knew something was happening. He then played a couple of minutes of the craziest feedback &quot;noise-rock&quot; avant-garde music I&#39;ve ever heard to finish off the first set. After Bill walked off stage I heard the Americans say: &quot;the first set was good, it&#39;s a shame about the technical issues at the end&quot; - I had to be very careful to make sure they couldn&#39;t hear me chuckling. . One of the craziest tunes on the album is &quot;Expressions of a Neurotic Impulse&quot; (embedded at the start of this post), the main theme of which is a jarring, nervous, almost-punk-rock motif. It doesn&#39;t take long until it descends into full chaos with some manic drumming from Ted Poor and Bill Frisell making full use of his pedal board. At first listen it may appear quite &quot;random&quot; without much forethought - however the more you listen the more you get out of it and you can notice the many layers to the soundscape they create. . Another highlight is the track &quot;Brittle Like Twigs&quot; (above). While slightly less crazy that &quot;Expressions of a Neurotic Impulse&quot; still has its fair share of free moments. It is often difficult to blend the outside free ideas with swing or groove but I feel &quot;Brittle Like Twigs&quot; is a great example of this done well. It also features a killer &quot;Weird Bill&quot; solo at the end With &quot;outside&quot; music it can often get overwhelming if the tempo and energy is high for the entire album. The real skill in constructing albums like this is to get the balance right betweenup tempo and lower tempo. One of the lower-tempo highlights on &quot;It&#39;s Mostly Residual&quot; is the track &quot;Patchwork&quot; (above). This appears beside &quot;Expressions of a Neurotic Impulse&quot; and the change in mood is striking. It starts off as something you could imagine hearing on a &quot;Country Bill&quot; album, but as it moves forward creates more of an &quot;uneasy&quot; feeling and it&#39;s a joy to hear the main theme slowly develop in this way. . With an album like &quot;It&#39;s Mostly Residual&quot; it&#39;s best to hear it in its entirety and picking out individual tracks like this does not really do it justice (I could have easily picked the other tracks to highlight - for example the New Orleans influenced crescendo to &quot;Chitter Chatter&quot;). So if you&#39;ve liked what you&#39;ve heard so far I&#39;d strongly suggest finding a copy of &quot;It&#39;s Mostly Residual&quot; and giving it a few listens. .",

            "title": "Una Mas and Icon 6",
            "content": "This week marks the 6th installment of the Plot Roasting &quot;Icon&quot; series - as you may remember this is a &quot;premium&quot; coffee series showcasing some of the rarest and highest quality coffees available today. This time however things are a little different: in previous installments we have had Gesha cultivars and crazy processing methods, this time things are much more &quot;pedestrian&quot;. When not relying on the unobtainium cultivars or fermentation science experiment processes there is very little place to hide and so I&#39;m hoping for a fantastic cup here. . The coffee is from San Ignacio, Peru - an origin I&#39;ve found has improved quality-wise significantly over the last few years. The farm is called &quot;Fidel Huancas&quot; and the coffee itself won 4th place in the &quot;Cup of Excellence&quot;. For those that don&#39;t know the &quot;cup of excellence&quot; competitions are sort of like a &quot;michelin star&quot; review for coffee. A panel of &quot;expert&quot; tasters compare many coffees back to back and try and find the best coffee a country has produced in that given year. Those that win awards can typically command a much higher price for their coffee. It&#39;s worth remembering that although cup of excellence is quite broad (there are 13 countries with cup of excellence competitions) it does not cover every origin and so some really great coffees miss awards for geographical reasons alone. It&#39;s also worth keeping in mind that what professional tasters look for need not be what you actually enjoy drinking (along with many other caveats relating to shipping times, roaster skills, etc.) That being said I do tend to enjoy the cup of excellence coffees I have tried in the past. . In terms of cultivar we have a yellow Caturra and the processing is washed. As I said a fairly standard cultivar and processing, which means the coffee has to be exceptional to justify the price. . As with previous Icon coffees this is a relatively small bag (150g) so this will be an espresso free week on the blog. Normal service will resume next week (I have another coffee dedicated to espresso alongside the Icon and it&#39;s a peach). . On the dry aroma I get soft and delicate floral notes of jasmine and honeysuckle. Supporting this is a honey note that gives a &quot;sweet&quot; note to the aroma. It is fairly delicate on the nose and is not the punchiest coffee you&#39;ll ever sniff. Once brewed into a filter coffee you have an extremely complex cup. The peach and apricot notes are very prominent as is the jasmine like floral backdrop. The acidity level of this coffee is what I&#39;d describe as &quot;just enough&quot; - it&#39;s not one I&#39;d describe as particularly high acidity but it is crisp enough to keep you coming back for more. As the cup cools it transforms, this is one that is very sensitive to temperature. I strongly recommend drinking from a very thin walled cup so it has chance to cool down so you can experience all it has to offer. During the cool down phase I noted down the following descriptors: bramble, fig, redcurrant, lime, and I could probably think of a few more. In terms of body and mouthfeel it is relatively low and the sweetness level is quite high but not overpowering. Overall a very balanced cup, and despite the complexity it is a very easy drink. It is one you can also just sit and enjoy without the flavours becoming too distracting. . As has been the case with all the Icons so far; this has been a knockout coffee and I look forward to next month&#39;s offering. . As is customary on &quot;Icon&quot; weeks I&#39;ve selected some iconic jazz to go alongside. This week it&#39;s another record from the Blue Note back catalogue from 1963: &quot;Una Mas&quot; by Kenny Dorham. . . &quot;Most underrated&quot; is a contentious label in the jazz world, no matter who you pick out you can claim somebody else is even more underrated than them. But with Kenny Dorham you may have a decent case for making that argument. He has appeared on many of the greatest recordings in Blue Note history (both under his name and as a sideman) yet still lacks the acolades and &quot;prestige&quot; of some of his peers. . Kenny started off as an active member on the be-bop scene, being part of the original Jazz Messengers as well as playing alongside Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins and Clifford Brown as well as the big bands of Dizzie Gillespie and Lionel Hamlityon (amongst others). He is perhaps best known for his post-bop work on Blue Note in the 1960s and in particular his partnership with Joe Henderson with whom he appeared a numerous records under either of their names or as sidemen under others names. The Dorham-Henderson partnership is perhaps once of the greatest in jazz history - in a very short period of time they managed to record large number of &quot;classic&quot; albums (with &quot;Una Mas&quot; being one). . A major part of Kenny&#39;s sound and songwriting style (at least during the 1960s) was the Latin and Cuban influences to his music. Latin and Cuban jazz have their own histories, but what Kenny managed to do so seemlessly was combine this with the language of be-bop. In this area he was somewhat of a pioneer with many taking influence from his compositions. The collaboration with Joe Henderson certainly helped in this regard given he was no slouch with regards to Latin influences either. In fact Kenny&#39;s most famous composition, &quot;Blue Bossa&quot;, appeared on the Joe Henderson album &quot;Page One&quot; from 1963. &quot;Blue Bossa&quot; has since become a standard in its own right. . Back to &quot;Una Mas&quot; itself, the lineup needs no introduction: . Kenny Dorham - trumpet | Joe Henderson - tenor saxophone | Herbie Hancock - piano | Butch Warren - bass | Tony Williams - drums | . I say this often in these &quot;icon&quot; series recordings: but any one of these musicians could be headline artists in their own right. Part of the joy of these recordings is hearing artists like Herbie Hancock be a &quot;mere&quot; sideman on a record. On &quot;Una Mas&quot; it never once feels like any one musician is trying to steal the limelight, they&#39;re all working to push the music to a better place. . Perhaps the only downside to &quot;Una Mas&quot; is its brevity: it clocks in at only 32 minutes in its original 3-track form (but feels even shorter), but thankfully an additional track was added in 1987 to bring it up to a 37 minute run time. But that should not be a reason to overlook the recording, every second is essentially a &quot;highlight&quot; and there is not a moment of filler on the album. . The album kicks off with the title track &quot;Una Mas&quot; (embedded at the start of this post), which is a built around a hard hitting Bossa-Nova groove. The main itself is punchy and catchy, one you might find yourself humming for days afterwards without realising. Then of course there are 3 killer solos from Dorham, Henderson and Hancock respectively. Given the tune&#39;s structure it is somewhat of a &quot;blank canvas&quot; and the improvisers can take it into whatever direction they choose. Dorham opts to stick to the Bossa-Nova vibe with the occassional use of a searing blues lick. Henderson does Henderson things and throws in some outside lines and more hard-bop vocabulary while Hancock sticks to his typical sophisticated harmonic style. . The second track on the album &quot;Straight Ahead&quot; (embedded below), as the name suggests, is a more straight ahead hard-bop romp. With a line-up like this at this time it would be a shame not hear them stretch their legs and that is certainly what they do here - it is essentially a canonical recording from the Blue Note hard-bop era. The rest of the album is comprised of &quot;Sao Paulo&quot; another Bossa influenced track but mellower than the chaotic &quot;Una Mas&quot; opener. The reissues of the album then feature the standard &quot;If Ever I Would Leave You&quot; by Loewe and Lerner, a great example of a hard-bop take on a ballad. . As with all the &quot;icon series&quot; albums this one is &quot;essential listening&quot; for any jazz fan, especially those who enjoy Blue Note recordings. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the Dorham/Henderson recordings from this period. .",

            "content": "The blog is back after a short 1 week hiatus: over the past couple of weeks I had being trying some &quot;new&quot; (to me) roasters and the quality level was frankly quite low. I&#39;m not in the business of writing negative reviews of coffee roasters, especially given the current economic climate for coffee companies generally, so took the week off. . Thankfully this week we&#39;re back with some high quality coffee goodness - we have another installment of my Kaffebox subscription. This time featuring a pair of filter roast coffees from Norwegian roasters: Austrått Kaffebrenneri. I have to admit I had never heard of these guys before (part of the joy of the Kaffebox subscription) so was very much looking forward to giving them a go. Their website (in Norwegian) does not give much away but shows they took 3rd place in the Norwegian coffee roasting championship in 2018 and 2nd placce in 2020 - so a sign they know what they&#39;re doing! . As you may recall with my Kaffebox subscription I dedicate one of the coffees to filter and one to espresso duties - this week the decision was made completely at random (so try not to read into any choices here). . On the filter side I opted for the Tanzanian &quot;JKT Itende&quot; - the cultivars appear to be N39, Bourbon and Kent (the latter being a variation on Typica that is more resistant to leaf-rust) and I believe the coffee is washed. Off the dry aroma I get berry notes mostly, it is fairly punchy but not an aroma bomb. As a filter the first thing I noticed was how clean the cup is (partly due to some particularly &quot;dirty&quot; cups in the preceeding weeks). The flavour profile consists of: blackcurrants/blackberries, apricots and good hit of honey sweetness. The cup is very sweet and juicy with just enough acidity to not be cloying. The mouthfeel is fairly thin and the aftertaste is quite intense but not particularly long-lived. It is not a super-complex cup of coffee compared to some, but it is certainly very enjoyable and it is easy to drink. . On the espresso side we have a Guatemalan &quot;Finca el Regalito&quot; - the cultivars are Caturra and Bourbon and again it is a washed coffee (I&#39;m assuming &quot;vasket&quot; is &quot;washed&quot; in Norwegian). The dry aroma gives off a honey type quality, again it is punchy but there is not huge sillage. The roast level on this coffee is visibly very light which often equates to an espresso that is tough to dial in. That is not the case here however, it is suprisingly forgiving. For the past week I have been experimenting with the B-Plus screen (full review coming later) so was adjusting my grind and recipe quite often and I didn&#39;t end up with a single shot less than good. I found a 1:2.5 sort of range to be the best for this coffee with the temp at full whack. The flavour notes I pick up are dried fruits, baking spices, brown sugar and cocoa. It makes for a syrupy and sticky shot with very high levels of sweetness. The acidity is somewhat muted which makes it very easy to drink. Again not the most complex shot I&#39;ve ever had but very enjoyable and easy to drink. . Overall another good installment from Kaffebox - Austrått will definitely be one I&#39;ll keep an eye out for in future. . For the jazz this week we are taking a first look at the &quot;hot off the press&quot; album from Julian Lage: &quot;Squint&quot; - since this was released yesterday (11th June 2021) this will be a &quot;first listen&quot; review. . . This is Julian&#39;s second appearance on the blog, in a prior post we looked at &quot;Love Hurts&quot; which was quite a restrianed look at ballads and standards (mostly). &quot;Squint&quot;, Julian&#39;s first release on Blue Note Records, takes a different approach: it is wilder, more ambitious, more virtuosic, freer and features (mostly) original compositions. I have been a fan of Julian&#39;s playing for a long time, what really impresses me is his fluidity and ease over the instrument. Listening/watching Julian it never seems like he is trying particularly hard, the guitar just seems an extension to his body and there&#39;s no blocker in the &quot;brain-guitar&quot; pathway. Sure, you might be able to find those with more technical &quot;chops&quot; but few seem as comfortable playing the instrument. This means that even when playing technically or harmonically complicated pieces he is still able to have &quot;feel&quot; and tell a story through his playing. . &quot;Squint&quot; is also the first recording to feature Julian&#39;s new signature Collings 470JL (I believe - at least the first since the guitar has been available) - based around a Gretsch duojet style guitar it marks a depature from the telecaster (or technically nachocaster) he has been known for. The change in tonality is quite evident - there is certainly more of a nasal quality to the break-up sounds and the cleans are a bit cleaner. He has also (in places) opted for more reverb and tremolo than in the past. Personally I&#39;m more a fan of the telecaster sound, but even so then tones on &quot;Squint&quot; are still better than 99% of jazz electric guitar sounds out there. . Some of the choice cuts on the album include the opener: &quot;Etude&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). As the name would suggest this is a solo guitar piece, somewhat designed as a technical &quot;practice&quot; piece. At a relatively short 2m27 it still packs a lot in - it could take a blog post in itself to analyse everything here. The main &quot;theme&quot; takes cues from Bach and classical music more generally, but this is blended with voice-leading jazz, blues and even the odd rock accents. The walk-down just after the main melody is a mind-bending lick, the use of open strings in such a line is just crazy. Watching him play you would be forgiven for thinking he was playing something trivial, it&#39;s honestly quite disheatening for the guitar players out there. . This is not a solo record however and Lage is joined by Dave King on drums and Jorge Roeder on the bass. The whole album has an intimate almost &quot;jazz club&quot; feel and comes across a bit like a live performance - owing to the interaction between the musicians. This is particularly apparent on the track &quot;Familiar Flower&quot; (above) which is one of the freer pieces on the album and takes clear nods from Ornette Coleman. A part of Julian&#39;s playing that really comes out here is how easily he can switch from the most outside free ideas to more inside groove-based playing. It never feels like he&#39;s playing outside &quot;for the sake of it&quot;. Two other tracks I want to make a note of: firstly the revisiting of &quot;Day and Age&quot;, a track that appeared on his 2015 album &quot;World&#39;s Fair&quot;. On the previous album it appeared as a solo acoustic piece and became a bit of a &quot;signature tune&quot; for Lage. On &quot;Squint&quot; we are treated to an electric trio version - it takes on a whole new personality, slightly more downbeat and contemplative (perhaps reflecting a change in Julian&#39;s personality in the 6 years between recordings). Undoubtedly there will be comparisons to Bill Frisell given the &quot;Americana&quot; vibe to the piece but Julian certainly has his own voice here. . The other track I want to highlight is the beautiful rendition of Johnny Mandel&#39;s &quot;Emily&quot;. Julian released a video playing a solo version of this tune during the start of lockdown last year (video above). This is one of my favourite ballads and Julian&#39;s version is up there with my favourite renditions. I think as a guitarist one of the hardest tasks to do is to play a &quot;simple&quot; ballad like this and keep it entertaining yet respectful to the source, many others would have layered reharmonization over reharmonization to the point of being unrecognizable. . The tunes selected here are some of my initial highlights but &quot;Squint&quot; is full of gems. &quot;Boo&#39;s Blues&quot; for example being a swinging blues with a hint of Monk to it. Although there isn&#39;t really a &quot;lead single&quot; to this album, perhaps the most accessible is &quot;Saint Rose&quot; (below) - if this doesn&#39;t become a staple of Julian&#39;s live shows from now on I&#39;ll be very surprised. . This &quot;review&quot; just reflects my intial impressions after a few listens of &quot;Squint&quot; - I&#39;m sure there&#39;s much more to uncover hidden away in these tracks. I&#39;d strongly suggest tracking down a copy and giving it a go. .",

            "title": "The Sound of Summer Running and Koppi",
            "content": "This blog post marks the next installment of my KaffeBox subscription. This time it features another of my favourite roasters: Koppi - located in Helsingborg, Sweden. They are perhaps one of the best known of the Scandinavian roasters and are highly acclaimed (and for good reason). I beleive they are also the originators of &quot;coffee tonic&quot; - a shot of espresso poured into a chilled tonic water with ice. With summer potentially around the corner it is a great choice for a drink on a hot day. . As you may remember my KaffeBox subscription consists of 2 bags each of 125g of coffee. I split these one on espresso duty and one on filter duty, so that I get enough to dial in the espresso properly. This week I selected based on origin, I went for the origin I typically find easiest to dial in for the espresso and the other for the filter. . Starting with the filter we have a Colombian coffee &quot;Finca El Prado&quot;. The cultivar is Caturra and the coffee has been wet fermented followed by a full wash and raised bed drying. Diving right into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma there is an unmistakable strawberry note to this coffee, but this plays supporting cast to a sugar-syrup or light caramel note. As you would expect the roast level is fairly light here. In the cup the strawberry meets many other red berries: redcurrants, raspberries, cherry, you name it. It&#39;s a very fruity cup. There is a sharpness there too, the bag lists passionfruit but I would describe it more as a tart raspberry quality personally. The cup has a medium body and is quite juicy in its quality. It is definitely more on the complex end of things and the various red fruits come to the forefront as it cools. As I would expect from Koppi: a really well executed and tasty cup. . On the espresso side we have a Costa Rican &quot;La Lia&quot; - a Catuai cultivar that has been fully washed. I am a big fan of Costa Rican coffee in espresso, I find it to typically be extremely forgiving and it&#39;s very difficult to mess up too much. This is true of this coffee also, the grind setting needed major adjustment from my previous espresso so my first shot had a 60s pull time - it was still delicious, albeit very intense. After dialing in I settled for a normale shot: 1:2 in 28s. This seemed to be the best compromise between mouthfeel and clarity for me. In terms of flavour note the predominant note is nuts, in particular hazelnuts and almonds. Alongside there is a crisp apple type acidity that cuts through and a stone fruit note. Overall it is not the most complex espresso in the world but it is very easy to drink, it&#39;s a coffee for when you just want a coffee. Again the execution is top level and it is truly a top class espresso. . Alongside Koppi this week, since London has had its first glimpses of summer, I have been listening to the 1997 release from Marc Johnson: &quot;The Sound of Summer Running&quot; . . Marc Johnson is a name that might not be instantly recognisable to many, he is not a household name and hasn&#39;t really had many &quot;hit&quot; records under his own name. However his back catalogue speaks for itself, having featured on albums from: Bill Evans, John Scofield, Lyle Mays, John Abercrombie and Stan Getz (plus many more). Having such an illustrious side-man career has clearly influenced his playing where you can hear the aforementioned (along with others) heavily in his playing. &quot;The Sound of Summer Running&quot; (named after a Ray Bradbury story) is perhaps one of Johnson&#39;s best known recordings as a band-leader. Most likely due to the truly stellar cast of musicians on show: . Marc Johnson – double bass | Bill Frisell – electric and acoustic guitars | Pat Metheny – electric and acoustic guitars, 42-string Pikasso guitar | Joey Baron – drums, tambourine | . The &quot;dual guitar&quot; setup is likely to be influenced by prior work with John Abercrombie who often makes use of such line-ups. It is not often you get to hear 2 of the jazz guitar titans playing together. It is also rare to hear Pat Metheny play a supporting role, aside from a few obvious exceptions in his early career, he is typically in the &quot;limelight&quot;. On &quot;The Sound of Summer Running&quot; we see a different side to Metheny&#39;s playing that we don&#39;t often see. Then of course you have Bill Frisell, for my money one of the best guitar compers in the business. Hearing his interplay with Metheny is a joy on this album. . Overall the album is quite a restrained affair, it is not so much about huge chops or crazy harmonizations but more about creating a &quot;mood&quot;. While the Metheny and Frisell influences are on show it is really all about Johnson&#39;s voice as a composer: 7 out of 10 tunes being penned by him (with Frisell taking 2 of the remaining credits and Metheny 1). The &quot;Summer&quot; feel is quite clear throughout and it&#39;s an album that is very hard to dislike, it&#39;s a bit of a mystery why it is not more popular than it is. . Some choice tracks include the opener &quot;Faith in You&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) which features a Metheny-ish main melody. The contrast in Metheny&#39;s and Frisell&#39;s solos is particularly interesting, Metheny being more at home but Frisell doing Frisell things. &quot;Union Pacific&quot; is another highlight (above) and perhaps the most &quot;straight-ahead&quot; with a strong swing and swagger. The main melody being played by Metheny and Frisell in unison is one of most memorable moments on the album for me and not something you get to hear very often. My last pick is the Frisell tune &quot;Ghost Town&quot; - one of his signature tunes. Getting to hear Metheny solo on this piece is a joy, the structure and changes are very far away from a typical Metheny tune so it is very interesting to see how he approaches it. Of course Frisell is right at home and works his magic on the tune. This version is as good as any of the versions on Frisell&#39;s own albums in my view. . While &quot;The Sound of Summer Running&quot; might not be considered &quot;essential&quot; listening by traditional standards, it is well worth hunting down a copy if you&#39;re after a no nonsense album that can fit into your day. .",

            "title": "Friday Afternoon in the Universe and Jairo Arcila",
            "content": "On the blog this week we&#39;re heading back to Exeter and the folks at Crankhouse Coffee. A couple of weeks ago we looked at a rather elegant Ecuadorian cup from them, this week we are going much wilder with a coffee from Colombia. . The coffee is called Jairo Arcila Villarazo Natural (EF2) - the farm is located in Quindio and the cultivar is Castillo. The suffix EF2 refers to &quot;extended fermentation 2 extra days&quot;. As you may have guessed by now we&#39;re looking at a highly fermeneted natural coffee here. The process is described as: an initial 24 hours dry anaerobic fermentation. Following this the cherries are placed into bags and stored at 22 celcius (through use of a water tank) for an additional 60 hours. The cherries then dry on raised beds until an 18% moisture content before going back in the bags for 50 hours and dried on raised beds until the moisture is 10.5%. The sheer extent of the fermentation suggests this is going to be a very funky cup. . Diving right into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma you get that unmistakable &quot;natural funk&quot; - it always reminds me of black forest gateaux, bruised fruits and sherry. To me this is not a &quot;tropical fruit&quot; type natural/anaerobic - more of a deeper boozy sort of natural. I do not typically go for these sorts of coffees but it is always nice to mix things up every now and again. . Served as a filter using my usual method: the first thing to note is that although this coffee is fairly high on the funk-o-meter it still has a good deal of clarity in the cup. The finish is long lasting but is fairly &quot;clean&quot; in nature. For me the major flavour notes are: bruised blueberries and cherry brandy. There is also an acidity that almost cuts through I would describe it as perhaps like a pink grapefruit, it is fairly subtle but it&#39;s just present enough to stop the cup being too cloying. As you&#39;d expect the sweetness is very high and there is quite a lot of body - although it&#39;s not one you&#39;ll have to chew. . As an espresso this coffee really shines. The sheer amount of sweetness means you can really cut back on the ratio to make the most of the mouthfeel. I found good results down to around 1:1.5 - knocking on the door of being a ristretto. In such a concentrated shot you get huge intensity and a luscious body, it almost feels like a dessert. Most coffees I tend to go for don&#39;t perform well as ristretto (in my opinion at least) so it is nice to come across one every now and again. The flavour notes are much the same as in the filter although the acidity disappears and the boozy notes are amplified. . Although outside of my typical coffee preferences I highly enjoyed drinking this one. It also goes to show the variety on offer at Crankhouse that you can have a super polite and refined washed Ecuadorian and this all-aboard-the-funky-bus natural Colombian from one roaster. . For the jazz this week it feels only right to go down the funky route. I have chosen an old favourite of mine: the 1995 release &quot;Friday Night in the Universe&quot; by Medeski, Martin and Wood. . . I&#39;ve mentioned this a few times on the blog but Medeski, Martin and Wood (MMW) were one of the first jazz acts I got into heavily. Before them I had mostly been listening to the &quot;classics&quot; by (mostly) musicians who had passed long before I started listening to them. With MMW there was a band writing and performing new music who I could see live and I was all for it. They were also one of the first bands I can remember forming a new &quot;scene&quot;. They were pretty much the first of the 90s/00s wave of bands lugging wurlitzers and hammonds around gigs and managed to capture a &quot;cool&quot; younger crowd with live shows focussed on dancing and partying as opposed to the typical quieter and more respectful jazz audiences. This of course spun up many copy-cat acts trying to capture the same vibe but none felt as authentic as MMw. Many years ago MMW were in fact one of the first acts I ever saw at Ronnie Scott&#39;s - but unfortunately it was not the best gig I&#39;ve ever been to. Their setlist was pitfully short (max 30 minutes) and they didn&#39;t seem to be enjoying their time playing. It was quite a devastating gig given how much I was looking forward to seeing them live. Thankfully this was a one off and I saw them many times since and have not been disappointed (a gig with John Scofield was a particular highlight). . It&#39;s interesting to see where &quot;Friday Night in the Universe&quot; sits within the MMW discography. Their first album &quot;Notes from the Underground&quot; does not feature the trademark organ sounds, it is a good album but does not &quot;feel&quot; like the MMW we know now. The second album &quot;It&#39;s a Jungle in Here&quot; begins to feature more organ sounds but is still heavily rooted in funk (of the Sly and the Family Stone type). Then came &quot;Friday Night in the Universe&quot; - here the organ sounds are expanded and the band started to play with the avant-garde. The avant-garde became a key component of the MMW sound, they would often switch from hard hitting funk to some of the most out there music in the blink of an eye. It&#39;s for that reason I consider &quot;Friday Night in the Universe&quot; the album were MMW hit their stride. . Perhaps the biggest &quot;hit&quot; off the album is &quot;Chubb Sub&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) - it showcases the MMW funk grooves in full swing. John Medeski providing the hip organ sounds, Billy Martin playing with the laid-back rock grooves and Chris Wood holding the whole thing together with some really restrained upright bass lines. Some of the MMW avant-garde craziness is shown on the short track &quot;House Mop&quot; (above) - despite being fairly free form there is still a sense of groove. The avant-garde is something they lent into heavily with their later work with John Zorn. You also have pieces such as &quot;Last Chance to Dance Trance (Perhaps)&quot; (below) - here the focus is more on dancing/partying with a heavy latin influence to the meter. With such a variety of tracks on &quot;Friday Night in the Universe&quot;, the album becomes a microcosm of both &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; MMW. It in some sense bridges the gap between much of their other work. It is an album I often find myself coming back to and one well worth hunting down if you have not yet heard it. .",

            "title": "The Blues and Abstract Truth and Icon 5",
            "content": "This week marks the return of the Plot Roasting Icon series. As you may recall this a coffee subscription consisting of &quot;unobtainium&quot; type coffees - some of the rarest and most sought after on the market. This installment is no different; it features another Gesha coffee this time from Diego Bermudez in Colombia. You may recall this name from the Assembly limited edition coffee from a few weeks back - this time we have a Gesha cultivar however. As with the forementioned coffee this weeks Icon coffee undergoes a complex multistage process. First the cherries are washed with sterilised water to reduce contamination. The whole cherries are then held in sealed tanks for 60 hours at 18 celcius, they are then depulped before entering a second anaerobic fermentation phase for 36 hours at 18 celcius. The coffee then undergoes a &quot;thermal shock&quot; wash procedure; first washing at 35 celcius then 12 celcius. This is followed by a controlled drying procedure for 29 hours at 35 celcius with relative humidity 25% until the grain humidity reaches 10-11%. . Diving right in to the coffee itself: on the nose I am getting honey and caramel notes off the dry aroma. Like many of the Gesha cultivar coffees I&#39;ve had it is a relatively restrained affair and there is not a huge sillage. Moving onto the filter: the first thing to strike me is just how complex this cup is. There is so much going on in the cup. It actually benefits from being consumed at a relatively cool temperature, at the higher temperatures the flavours can overwhelm. In terms of flavour notes there are big perfumed florals: lavendar, violet, jasmine - you name it. Alongside are the typical earl-grey tea type notes one would expect also. I&#39;ve also picked out stone fruit notes along with citrus (most notably grapefruit). The finish is very very sweet, reminding me of sherbet. This is a coffee to savour and ponder over each individual note, there is a lot to discover in this cup. . Due to a bit of a mix up I actually ended up with twice as much of this coffee as usual (300g) - which means for the first time I am able to try one of the Icons as an espresso. With a coffee this expensive it can be a little nerve-wracking to pull shots from, any sink-job dialing in shots are literally money down the drain! Fortunately however, this coffee required only minimal tweaks from the previous espresso I had been serving. I enjoyed this one at a 1:2.5 ratio in 28s with the machine temperature at full whack. As you&#39;d expect this makes a great espresso too. There is one overriding flavour note I wrote down: Haribo Fangtastic sweets! There is a definite sourness to the espresso, but in a good way - not an indication of underextraction way. Especially paired with the syrupy sugar sweetness, it has a real &quot;sweet and sour&quot; thing going on which is really cool. I can&#39;t remember having an espresso with this sort of profile before so it was very enjoyable. That being said the complexity does get kind of lost so I do think filter is the best way to enjoy this coffee. . Yet again Plot are killing it with the Icon series - very much looking forward to what the future brings with this subscription! As is customary on Icon series posts: on the jazz side we are looking at an iconic album. This time around we are going back to 1961 on Impulse records: Oliver Nelson and &quot;The Blues and Abstract Truth&quot;. . . Oliver Nelson is one of the many jazz artists who died far too young at just 43 years old. It&#39;s perhaps for this reason his name is not as recognisable as others from his era. As a result &quot;The Blues and Abstract Truth&quot; is often an album overlooked by the jazz newbie who will not discover it until much later in their jazz journey (and kick themselves for not finding it earlier). To those in the know it is one of the most respected albums from the post-bop era. . Nelson is a saxophonist and clarinetist, on &quot;Blues&quot; he appears playing tenor and alto sax, however he is perhaps best known as a composer or arranger. &quot;The Blues and Abstract Truth&quot; offers a peek into his compositional sensibilities, with just a 7 piece band the tunes are not quite as expansive and experimental as some of his later works. He was also an acomplished composer outside of the jazz idiom having composed for classical and chamber groups along with TV and film scores. It would have been very interesting to see where he headed artistically had he had more time. . The lineup on &quot;The Blues and Abstract Truth&quot; is quite impressive in itself: . Freddie Hubbard – trumpet | Eric Dolphy – alto saxophone, flute | Oliver Nelson – tenor saxophone, alto saxophone | George Barrow – baritone saxophone | Bill Evans – piano | Paul Chambers – bass | Roy Haynes – drums | . A true superstar lineup, each more than worthy of a blog post in their own right. For me part of the charm of this album is the contrast in the soloing: Hubbard offering up his usual powerful exuberance, Nelson being more introverted and contemplative and Dolphy being Dolphy! . The &quot;standout&quot; track on the album is the opener &quot;Stolen Moments&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) which has subsequently become a standard in its own right. With so many horns they are able to produce some very rich and wide reaching chord voicings that add to the overall feel of the piece. Perhaps the standout however is the flute solo by Dolphy - an integral part of the recording and highly memorable. Another Dolphy highlight is in the 4th track &quot;Yearnin&quot; (below) where he presents the most &quot;outside&quot; playing on the album with his solo. . Another standout piece (and one of my favourites) is the second track: &quot;Hoe Down&quot; (above), based on the theme from Aaron Copland&#39;s &quot;Rodeo&quot;. The genius of this track is that it sets you up thinking you&#39;re in for a corny American folk piece before descending into some of the finest post-bop soloing you&#39;ll ever hear. Hubbard&#39;s solo is the one that really stands out for me on this one. As with all the albums featured in the Icon series: this one is a &quot;must listen&quot; if you are a jazz fan. Be sure to pick up a copy through whatever medium you listen to your music. .",

Crankhouse are based in Exeter and have been known for cranking out good quality and interesting coffees for many years. Unfortunately for them they are a roaster I often &quot;forget&quot; about and should really buy from more often. . The coffee we&#39;re looking at today is &quot;Galo Semlantes Finca Santa Rosa&quot; it is an Ecuadorian, Typica Mejorado cultivar. We talked about this cultivar fairly recently in another post so we won&#39;t retread that ground again here. In addition to the origin/cultivar, which usually indicates a high quality cup, the processing of this coffee is intriguing. It is described as a &quot;washed double fermentation&quot;. After being picked/selected cherries are placed in sealed fermentation tanks for 48 hours until an exact pH of 4.1 is achieved. They are then pulped and placed in open tanks for another 48 hours until the pH reaches 3.7. The coffee is then fully washed and dried on African beds to reach a humidity of 11%. Finally coffee is left in bags for a month to stabilise. This is clearly a complicated and exacting process. It is definitely nice to see processing develop through the years, when I first got into specialty the processing was described as: &quot;left to dry in the sun, turning occassionally&quot; - quite a far cry from the scientific approaches adopted today. . No amount of complex processing and exotic cultivars matter unless the quality in the cup is also good. So let&#39;s dive straight in. On the dry aroma I do not get a huge bouquet or sillage. There are pleasant caramel notes and a delicate florality to the nose but it is not a heavy hitter. This comes across as a very polite, refined and complex coffee - the exact style that I tend to enjoy. . As a filter I am reminded of a very specific product that likely nobody but me will remember: when I was very young there was a very sweet &quot;peach water&quot; that came in a frosted glass bottle. The intial flavour hit of this coffee is remarkebly similar to this. It has a sugary sweet syrupy taste and really delicate peach notes to it. There are also notes of sweet nectarine and a stick rosehip floral note also. This is kind of like an Ethiopian coffee with the volume turned up. The flavours are quite intense but still have a high level of clarity. It is a fairly &quot;linear&quot; coffee and the flavour profile doesn&#39;t really change much as the cup cools, this makes it very easy to drink. . Moving onto the espresso: this coffee was one of the easier coffees to dial in. Fairly traditional recipes tend to work well with it and you can get some good syrupy mouthfeel out of it. The flavour profile is similar to the filter, but obviously much more concentrated. It&#39;s almost like a highly reduced necatarine syrup, extremely drinkable and in terms of pure flavour one of the most tasty. As an espresso some of the more interesting rosehip like florals get lost however, so it&#39;s not the most complex shot around, but there is a place for super tasty easy to drink espresso that does not require much brain power to enjoy. . All in all a good showing from Crankhouse and a good reminder that I should order from them more often. . On the jazz side this week we&#39;re going to take a first look at the new album &quot;XXXX&quot; from Wollny, Parisien, Lefebvre and Lillinger on the ACT record label. . . We should probably start with fair warning: this is not an &quot;easy&quot; album to listen to. This one is comfortably within the avant-garde, free end of the spectrum. The music on show is almost entirely improvised (with the exception of one piece arranged by Wollny). It is very exploratory and pushes the boundaries, not something you would want to just &quot;put on in the background&quot;. . The album is listed under the names of all 4 players on the record, with pianist Michael Wollny taking &quot;headline&quot; spot. Wollny is more known for his &quot;straight ahead&quot; sensibilities typically in piano trio and duo formats. I have not heard everything he has ever recorded but I believe this is his first foray into fully free froms. I have seen Wollny live a few times in the past and my reaction has always been: &quot;that was good, but it didn&#39;t move me&quot;. &quot;XXXX&quot; has certainly made me stop and take note. On the album he plays both acoustic, electric and synth instruments and there is extensive use of layering throughout. He definitely takes at least some inspiration from electronic and dance music and comparisons to Jean Michel Jarre instantly come to mind. Alongside Wollny are regular stable mates: Soprano saxophonist Emile Parisien and bassist Tim Lefebvre. You can tell that these guys are completely comfortable playing with each other. In a free structureless setting you have to be completely comfortable that your bandmates will get you out of trouble otherwise the whole project can become a disaster. There is often a misconception that playing free is &quot;easy&quot; and you just &quot;make stuff up&quot; - this is definitely not the case, as evidenced by the countless dreadful free projects that have spun up over the years. . The real driving force behind this album, however, is drummer Christian Lillinger. He brings such sheer energy to the music, it is almost impossible not to be swept up in it. He plays with such reckless abandon, but still manages to capture the right moment to bring the tempo down and when to sit out entirely. It is a truly incredible performance. . The music takes many twists and turns it is almost impossible to cover everything. There are truly out there free jazz moments, followed by 70s rock-fusion, electronic dance music, heavy funk grooves and down tempo ballad like passages too. I find the album has almost a meditative or hallucinogenic quality even amidst the craziness. I&#39;m clearly not alone in this since the cover-art features the chemical structure of psilocybin - the active component of magic mushrooms. It is an album best listened to start to finish as an entire piece so I have not mentioned individual tracks here (although you can find a few embedded in this post). . While this album is not one for everybody it is a truly fantastic achievement and a release I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying. If you want to hear some original modern jazz there are far worse places to start than &quot;XXXX&quot;. .",

            "title": "Genealogy and April Coffee",
            "content": "This week marks the next installment in the KaffeBox subscription series. The April installment features April Coffee Roasters (I see what they did there, very punny). April are a roaster based in Copenhagen, Denmark. They are a roaster I&#39;ve wanted to try for a while but the shipping costs/times mean I rarely stray outside of UK based roasters and when I do I like to stick to roasters I know and love. I was therefore very happy to see April coffees arrive this month. . As you may recall my Kaffebox subscription consists of 2 different 125g bags of coffee each month (both roasted for filter). This is not enough to dial in both filter and espresso comfortably so I dedicate one to filter duty and one to espresso duty. This month I selected based on origin and what I tend to prefer for each coffee style. . Starting off with the filter side of things we have a washed coffee from Ethiopia. It is from the Arsosala washing station in Guji, and what is interesting about this coffee is it is a Bourbon cultivar. Typically with Ethiopia you get &quot;heirloom&quot; or &quot;mixed landrace&quot; cultivars (although the specific cultivars are increasingly being identified). On the dry aroma I get caramel and candy notes along with the typical florals you would expect from a washed Ethiopian. In the cup we are treated to a very clean profile, it is refined and delicate. We have a very perfumed and floral cup with a lot of complexity that evolves as the temperature cools. Alongside we have lemon-y citrus notes and a sweet sugar-syrup vibe. The aftertaste and finish are extremely clean and fairly short lived, body is low and the acidity level is medium. It is a very good example of what a washed Guji Ethiopian should be, and the sort of coffee I can drink by the pint and still enjoy. . On the espresso side we have a Costa Rican coffee from the Volcan Azul farm. The cultivar in question is H17 which is a hybrid cultivar. It is not one I am familiar with (I have had H3 a few times) and I can&#39;t find out many details about the exact genetic make-up. The coffee has undergone a yellow honey processing. This coffee has really blown me away as an espresso. I find honey processed Costa Ricans the most forgiving bean for espresso typically but this was a whole different level of forgiving - every single thing I tried was fantastic. It made choosing an &quot;ideal&quot; recipe next to impossible. In the end I just went to a regular 1:2 ratio so I could appreciate the thicker rich mouthfeel. The flavours on show were hazelnut, almond, honey, sugar-syrup and plum. It is not the most complicated coffee I&#39;ve ever had but it is incredibly drinkable and enjoyable - it is just a great example of what espresso can be. Again like with the filter the coffee is very clean and the aftertaste is fairly shortlived. . Overall 2 very strong showings from April, I&#39;ll certainly be on the lookout for coffees from them in the past. When I&#39;m feeling flush I might splash out on some of their more exclusive Gesha offerings. . On the jazz side we are taking a first look at a 2021 release from Code Quartet - &quot;Genealogy&quot;. . . Code Quartet are a relatively new project and &quot;Genealogy&quot; represents their debut which was released on April 23rd 2021. The band formed 4 years ago in Montreal, Canada. The idea behind the project was to explore &quot;chord-less&quot; music and they cite the Ornette Coleman groups from the 1950s as a primary influence. They also list the work of Fletcher Henderson, Charlie Haden and Paul Bley as influencing their work. . The quartet is made up of: . Christine Jensen - saxophones | Lex French - trumpet | Adrian Vedady - acoustic bass | Jim Doxas - drums | . By forgoing instruments with the ability to play chords they open up many possibilities within the music. The roles of &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot; players become a little harder to define and it becomes more about the interplay between instruments. On this particular project there seems to be around a 50:50 split between the compositional and improvisational aspects and it is evident that the musicians are very comfortable playing with each other, this allows them to take plenty of risks and push the boundaries. . Despite the influences listed above the opening track &quot;Tipsy&quot; (embedded at the start of the post) sounds more like a tune you&#39;d hear on a Hank Mobley record than an Ornette Coleman one, but this is no bad thing. The focus of the tune is the funky-soul jazz swing. Jensen taking a tasty Rollins inspired solo part way through. It is not the most complex or original piece you&#39;ll ever hear but it is a style that you don&#39;t hear explored much anymore so it is a nice surprise to open the album. Perhaps the most complex piece on the album is &quot;Wind Up&quot; (above), here the band strays more into the Coleman inspired &quot;free&quot; style. The tune is based around quite a complicated rhythmic figure but Doxas manages to keep things grooving and it doesn&#39;t sound like a &quot;music degree show piece&quot; like many modern jazz pieces do. Over the top we have a twisting harmonic idea which shows the Jensen-French interplay off to full effect. Each player manages to serve the music and each other but there is still a sense of individual expression: Jensen going for a wilder outside staccato playing style while French sticks to more inside flowing legato ideas. The contrast works well together and it never feels like a &quot;jam session&quot; comprised of a random set of musicians. . What really makes this album interesting however is the sheer variety of music on show. The two tracks listed above are very different but share the same &quot;DNA&quot;. This is echoed throughout the entire album - we have the (very clearly) Coleman influenced title track which would have fit right in on a 50s album from Ornette. Alongside we have the more angular modern jazz influenced &quot;Watching It All Slip Away&quot;. The track &quot;Day Moon&quot; feels like it was inspired by &quot;Tijuana Moods&quot; era Charles Mingus and the album closes with &quot;Beach Community&quot; which has a Carribean-lilt which shows more than a passing resemblence to the Rollins classic &quot;St Thomas&quot;. The quartet covers quite a wide variety of jazz history in just the 51 minute play time of the album, however do not think of this as a &quot;covers band&quot; - there is a very definitely &quot;Code Quartet&quot; sound on show. . Overall this is a strong debut album. It is definitely a little &quot;rough around the edges&quot; in places but this kind of adds to its charm. Unlike many modern jazz offerings they do not let perfection be the enemy of the good. &quot;Code Quartet&quot; will definitely be a group I&#39;ll keep an ear-out for in the future as this debut shows a lot of promise. .",

            "title": "All Kooked Out and Diego Bermudez",
            "content": "This week on the blog we are looking at another &quot;limited edition&quot; coffee - this time from the Brixton based Assembly Coffee Roasters (one of this blogs favourite roasters). Assembly do not release &quot;limited&quot; coffees very often (I believe this is only the 5th or so they&#39;ve ever offered), so expectations are high for this one. . The coffee itself is from famed Colombian producer: Diego Bermudez. Widely regarded as one of the best producers for &quot;experimental processing&quot; in the world. They are really pushing the boundaries of coffee processing with meticulous attention to detail and a careful approach. They are based in El Tambo, Cauca - located in the south-west corner of Colombia slightly towrards the border with Ecuador. . The coffee itself is of Castillo cultivar, in its lineage there are some robusta-arabica hybrids which made Castillo a bit of a &quot;controversial&quot; cultivar in the past with the specialty movement. This seems to have largely died down now however and people are appreciating the quality in the cup - typically considered on par with Typica, Bourbon, etc. The really cool part of the Castillo cultivar however is its resistance to leaf rust, a growing concern for global coffee production. . The thing that makes this coffee special however is its processing. Whole cherries are fermented anaerobically for 48 hours at a strict 18 degrees celcius. Following this cherries are de-pulped and they go back in to anaerobically ferment for another 48 hours, this time at 20 celcius. The coffee then undergoes a &quot;thermal shock&quot; washing process whereby an initial washing at 40 celcius occurs, followed by a much cooler 12 celcius wash. The resulting beans then undergo a temperature controlled drying at 35 celcius until the moisture level reaches 10-11%. This is a really complicated multi-stage process so it is understandable that this is a higher priced &quot;limited&quot; coffee, the question is: does it make a difference in the cup? . As usual we start by looking at the dry aroma: this coffee is a bit of a &quot;fruit bomb&quot;. The aroma is incredibly sweet and there are tropical fruits aplenty - pineapples, papaya, passionfruits, honeydew melon and a fair few more. Certainly an enticing start to this coffee. . Moving over to the filter: again the sweetness is evident. It has an almost sugar-syrup quality both in terms of sweetness but also body which is quite big for a coffee roasted so lightly. Again the main flavours of note are the punchy tropical fruits: passionfruit is listed as a taste note on the label and it&#39;s hard to disagree with that really. I would add that there are floral background notes to this one too, it&#39;s not a perfumed Ethiopian but in the aftertaste there are certainly hints of lavendar. The cup is extremely complex and takes on a number of different characters as it cools, there&#39;s a stage where the tropical fruits give way to more &quot;traditional&quot; plum and raspberry type notes which is a nice surprise. In terms of acidity I would say this is at the mid-high end of things, and despite such a &quot;heavy&quot; processing the cup remains clean. . In the espresso I found this coffee a little finnicky to dial in. It is prone to being a little too sharp and acidic unless you nail the grind size. Once dialed in however it is a delight. I settled on a med-high heat level on my machine, a 5s pre-infuse followed by a 24s pull aiming for a ratio of 1:2.2 was what I settled on. By going a little shorter than one might expect with a filter roast left the syrupy mouthfeel in tact and the coffee has enough sweetness that there&#39;s no need to go any longer. Again the tropical fruit salad was the major flavour profile and the sweetness was very very high. Once dialed in a very enjoyable and drinkable espresso and one I&#39;m sad to see the back of. . All in all another knockout coffee from Assembly, hopefully they can bring us many more interesting limited editions to wrap our tastebuds around! . On the jazz side this week the magic of &quot;shuffle&quot; reminded me of a fun album from 1998 - Stanton Moore&#39;s debut album &quot;All Kooked Out&quot;. . . Stanton Moore may not be a name you have heard often before - at least if you&#39;re on this side of the atlantic. He is a drummer from New Orleans who is very much a part of the scene over there. He has a few recordings under his own name and as part of groups &quot;Galactic&quot; and &quot;Garage A Trois&quot; - each featuring a &quot;jazz funk meets jam band&quot; sort of vibe. In the late 90s through mid 00s the &quot;jazz-funk-jam&quot; thing was a fairly big scene thanks to the likes of Medeski Martin and Wood. In recent times Stanton has also become a drum educator. On &quot;All Kooked Out&quot; Stanton is joined by two musicians who he worked with previously through the &quot;Galactic&quot; group: 8 string guitarist Charlie Hunter and saxophonist Skerik. There are others rounding out the lineup but the real highlight of the album is hearing these 3 work together. The album was recorded in a week long session in a &quot;live&quot; style: there were no overdubs, they just play through the tunes. I really enjoy recordings done this way as you can hear the players excitement and energy come through, with too many edits the soul can be sucked from the music - especially for &quot;funk&quot; styles which are more about attitude than perfection. . Charlie Hunter is likely the &quot;biggest name&quot; on this album. During the 2000s he became somewhat of a &quot;poster boy&quot; of jazz guitar, he is known for playing 8 and 7 string guitars that are in some sense &quot;hybrid&quot; guitar and bass. This allows him to play basslines, chords and melodies simultaneously giving him plenty of freedom in composing and improvising. I have to admit I never got as &quot;into&quot; Hunter as many people are, I can appreciate his talent and ability but I don&#39;t often dig out his records to listen to. On &quot;All Kooked Out&quot; however he is a perfect fit, he has some great funk chops and the interplay with Stanton is great throughout. . Skerik really adds another dimension to this album. He is listed as playing: &quot;saxophonics and kookification&quot; on the album - the latter being a good descriptor. By combining his saxophone with various electronics and effects he is able to provide some &quot;other worldly&quot; sounds to the album. This elevates the album from being just another &quot;jazz-funk&quot; album to something a bit special. A lot of what sticks in your mind from this album is Skerik&#39;s contributions - at least for me. It is not just a bunch of &quot;tricks&quot; though, he provides some really musical solos throughout too. . The album kicks off with the track &quot;Tchfunkta&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) - which sets the tone for the rest of the album. As the name suggests it is based around a funk groove driven forward via Stanton&#39;s drums, Charlie&#39;s heavily chorused guitar (which admittedly sounds a bit dated now) dances over the top and the flourishes are added by Skerik. This is largely the formula throughout the album. One of the more interesting pieces is &quot;Stanton Hits the Bottle&quot; (above) - where Stanton literally hits the bottle rather than his drum kit for the percussion track. A cute idea, a fun play on words and a rather good track in its own right. &quot;All Kooked Out&quot; is unlikely to be an &quot;earth shattering&quot; album that will completely change your views on jazz. However it is an easy album to listen to and is certainly enjoyable. It is worth hunting down if you have not heard it before. .",

            "content": "This week on the blog we are looking at another coffee from Plot Coffee Roasting. I initially did not intend to write about this coffee on the blog, I was keeping it as my &quot;espresso option&quot; while enjoying the Icon Series 4 from last week&#39;s blog. However 2 things forced it up the agenda: 1) it is a cool and interesting coffee and 2) I need a bit more time to dial in the next coffee I am going to write about. . The coffee this week is called: Andreas Cortes - Pink Bourbon by Plot themselves. Andreas being owner of Finca Eucaliptos in Pitaltio, Huila, Colombia - where this coffee originates. By this point you&#39;ll also realise we&#39;re looking at a pink bourbon cultivar. Pink bourbon is a hybrid of the more common red and yellow bourbons (named after the colour of their fruit). This hybrid is hard to grow and hard to isolate so it is relatively rare. It is noted, however, that it generally offers high cup scores and has shown good (or at least better) resistance to leaf rust - which is of course a big bonus. . The coffee itself undergoes a 24 hour resting period before being de-pulped and fermented for 60 hours in sealed bags before being fully washed and dried on patios for 18 days. . Diving straight into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I don&#39;t get a huge amount of anything coming off. I would describe it mostly as a &quot;neutral sweet&quot; quality, like opening a bag of caster sugar. With a bit more focus you can just about pick off some citrus and floral notes but they are very feint. As we&#39;ve stated many times before: this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean much. . Moving onto the filter option: forewarning here - I only had 1 cup of filter from this coffee, so these are genuine initial responses. The first thing I jotted down with this coffee was &quot;clean&quot; - not just due to flavour clarity but profile too. There is a big citrus-y hit in the front, pink grapefruits and lemons mostly. These give a very clean quality to the cup. Following that I get a bit of a resin-y pine-needle sort of quality, again giving a fresh and airy vibe to the cup. In the aftertaste there are delicate floral notes that, while not particularly strong, do have staying power. In terms of sweetness vs acidity - for me it lies a little more to the acidic side but there is a plenty of sweetness in this cup too. The mouthfeel is quite big, adding to the resin-y pine-needle note I mentioned previously. . Most of my time with this coffee has been via espresso - to me this is where this coffee is right at home. Dialling it in is a little finnicky, it is a light roast designed for filter primarily, and you need to whack the machine temp right up (one day I forgot to do this and left the machine cool from a dark decaf roast I was drinking the previous night - it did not work well with this coffee at all). In terms of ratio I got to about 1:2.25 as a sweetspot, 7s pre-infuse then a 27s pull. The results are outstanding. The shot is extremely vibrant and zingy, sort of like a very crisp lemonade with a big slice of pink-grapefruit in it. I could see some people despising this as an espresso for being too acidic and bright but I enjoyed it a lot. While it&#39;s bright and crisp it doesn&#39;t stray into &quot;battery acid&quot; territory at all for me. Even when I didn&#39;t nail it when dialing in the results were just a bit flat as opposed to being a sink job. The margin between fantastic and average with this one are quite fine though I found, it took me a few shots to really get things where they needed to be - but then I was handsomely rewarded for it. . On the jazz side this week I dug out a record from 2010 from the band Soulive, in the form of their tribute to The Beatles: &quot;Rubber Soulive&quot;. . . I have to admit I was late to the Soulive party. The band started by releasing their debut EP in 1999 with their debut LP coming a year later. I knew of them around the mid-2000s but didn&#39;t really give them much attention at that time, Medeski Martin and Wood were more my thing so I was pretty big on them. It wasn&#39;t until the late 2000s when I really became aware of them. I was working on a new musical project at the time and the bassist of the band lent me a pile of CDs of his biggest influences - a couple of these were Soulive records, and I became to realise what I had been missing out on. As you could likely guess from the name: &quot;Soulive&quot; are largely in the &quot;Soul Jazz&quot; mold. They tend to have catchy, uptempo tunes that span jazz-soul-funk-rock. They have experimented (a lot) with additional musicians and vocalists over the years but the core of the band is an organ trio: . Alan Evans - Drums | Neil Evans - Organ/Piano | Eric Kranso - Guitar | . Which is the lineup featuring on &quot;Rubber Soulive&quot;. They rip through 11 tunes from The Beatles back catalogue, sticking solely to the &quot;big hits&quot; rather than finding the more obscure tracks. As you would expect from a jazz-funk band the focus is well and truly on the groove, if you&#39;re looking for a complex re-harmonization of Lennon pieces this is not the one for you. But if you want a groovy jam-band party atmosphere and some familiar melodies you could do a lot worse. . One of my choice cuts on the album is &quot;Revolution&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). Likely everybody will be fairly familiar with this track already so it is not easy to take it in a new direction. The Soulive boys decided instead of leaning into the strong rock-beat of the original they would take it into an RnB direction with a Booker T and the MGs style groove. If you can get through this tune without tapping your feet you are a better man than I. . Another fun track on the album is &quot;Help&quot; (above). Here Soulive go for a tongue-in-cheek swing feeling, almost with a lounge-jazz vibe. As the track goes onthe energy increases and by the end Alan is using a really strong and driving drum beat. The whole track is a lot of fun but also features some rather tasty organ playing from Neil. Of course the greatest of all The Beatles is George Harrison and there are 3 of his tunes covered on this album. Perhaps the most adventurous of these being the album closer: &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (above). A tune that has been covered to death at this point, with basically every guitar player having played it at some point. It is therefore quite difficult to come up with a &quot;fresh&quot; take on it, but I feel Soulive achieve that here. They stick pretty closely to the original melody and harmony throughout. Instead adding colour through groove and timbre. Some of Eric&#39;s phrasing in particular is very tasty, as are the tasteful use of effects which add rather than detract from the piece. . Overall a fun little album to check out. It&#39;s not one that will require a great deal of effort to listen to, just an easy &quot;feel good&quot; sort of album. Not all jazz need be complicated and require a great deal of effort to enjoy. .",

            "title": "In N Out and Icon 4",
            "content": "This coming friday (16th April) marks the first anniversary of the JazzCoffeeStuff blog! Unintentionally this coincides with another special coffee from Plot Coffee Roasting through their Icon series. As you may remember the Icon series is a &quot;150g a month&quot; subscription offered by Plot featuring some of the most sought after and rare coffees availavle. This is the 4th edition of this series. . The coffee in question is from Ecuador, an origin that may not be familiar to some. Most think of cacao rather than coffee from Ecuador, but those familiar with the specialty coffee scene know that there are some fantastic coffees to be had. Perhaps what is most interesting about this coffee is the cultivar: Typica Mejorado. I admit that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever tried this particular cultivar before, apparently a cross between Bourbon and an unknown Ethiopian landrace. Certainly an intriguing proposition given the cup quality of both of these cultivars. Interestingly, doing some research a few sources claim that it is a cross between Bourbon and Gesha - but this seems to be speculative at best (although would likely help achieve a higher price for the coffee). . The processing here is a natural. Ecuador has a fairly humid climate which makes natural processing problematic. This coffee undergoes a dry fermentation for 48 hours before spending 15 days in a solar powered drying chamber that exactly controls the coffees environment. Following this the coffee spends the rest of the time on raised African beds within a polytunnel. This sort of attention to detail at the processing stage is really what sets some of these super high scoring coffees a part. . Let&#39;s just dive right in: on the dry aroma I get a strong punch of honey straight off the bat. In addition I get the sort of floral notes one would ordinarily associate with Ethiopian coffees. This coffee is off to a good start, as usual we move on to my usual pour-over - I&#39;m currently still on Hario v60 papers instead of my usual chemex due to supply chain issues but have been appreciating the change. Taking the first sip immediately I&#39;m struck by how sweet this coffee is, it is syrup-y sugar-y and honey-y. This is up there as one of the sweetest coffees I&#39;ve had in a while, if you like sweetness it is one for you. In terms of flavour profile the honey-floral combo is certainly there - a hit of honey at the front which mellows to perfumed florals in the aftertaste. In the middle however it is a bit of a fruit bomb: strawberry is certainly present, apricots too, mangos and papaya make a bit of a showing. There is a lot going on in the cup, it is one that you should really sit down and savour but it is surprisingly easy to drink too. In terms of acidity I would describe it as low or at a push medium, there&#39;s so much sweetness it&#39;s kind of hard to notice the acidity in my opinion. The body is quite high but not one of those coffees that you can chew on. . As with previous Icon coffees I didn&#39;t make any espresso, next week&#39;s blog post should feature some espresso goodness. . Yet again Plot knock it out of the park with their Icon series. 4 out of 4 bangers so far, and I am looking forward to next month&#39;s offering. . Since this friday marks the one year anniversary of JazzCoffeeStuff, on the jazz side I thought we should head back to the first artist featured: Joe Henderson with another of his Blue Note recordings &quot;In &#39;N Out&quot;. . . Before even getting into the music itself it is worth taking a moment to appreciate the album artwork. One of my favourite covers in the history of Blue Note, a near perfect example of the Reid Miles aesthetic. It still looks as fresh today as it did when the album was released in January 1965. . I make no apologies: I am a huge Joe Henderson fan. My love for his playing can be summed up in the title of this album: &quot;In &#39;N Out&quot; - for me nobody before or since has had the ability to walk the line between inside and outside playing. He has the ability to play the craziest free-jazz lines fit with the most pedestrian chord changes, and meanwhile play an absolutely pure and simple melody in the midst of a free-jazz frenzy. Sometimes he even can start a lick playing a blues and by the end be in the realms of avant-garde - and you don&#39;t even notice it. This is especially true for his playing on Blue Note around this period, you can pick up any record he appears on during this time and you&#39;ll be blown away. . On &quot;In &#39;N Out&quot; the supporting cast isn&#39;t too shabby either: on trumpet you have regular stable-mate Kenny Dorham, with whom Joe recorded many times - all of which magical. On piano we have McCoy Tyner - one of the true stars of the hard-bop era and again appears regularly with Joe. On the bass we have Richard Davis who has played on records spanning all of the sub-genres of jazz from bop to free. On the drums is Elvin Jones - possibly my favourite drummer of all time, he always finds a unique way of swinging and can only be described as a jazz legend. . The album kicks off with the title track (embedded at the start of this post). It kicks off with a time-twisting hard-bop type melody with Joe and Kenny in unison (showing off their near telepathic communication). This is on top of a typical Elvin swing - his way of emphasing the beat gives the melody a hurried chaotic feeling. It doesn&#39;t take too long to get into Joe&#39;s first solo on the album. It features all the hallmarks of his playing: short stabby phrases, the unpredictable use of space, large intervals, ghost notes and trills. With so many &quot;tricks&quot; like these it&#39;s amazing at how well Joe can construct a solo, it&#39;s completely logical and flows from one idea to the next. McCoy then takes his turn, again sticking to his tried and tested use of fourths (mostly). Kenny then takes his turn with perhaps one of the most daring solos in his back catalogue. Typically you associate Kenny with the latin-influenced music and sticking fairly close to the melody but here he gets a little more experimental. The album itself consists of 2 parts: the first 3 tracks being tunes penned by Henderson himself and the last 2 by Dorham. As one would expect the Dorham tunes feature a latin and bossa feel, in contrast to the hard-bop/free sound of the Henderson pieces. One of the Dorham pieces is &quot;Short Story&quot; (above). . &quot;Short Story&quot; is typical Dorham through and through but the personnel on this album takes it in a different direction. You have Elvin&#39;s drum beats adding a unique flavour to the latin piece. It would have been easy to just stick to the &quot;typical&quot; drum beats featured in latin jazz but Elvin&#39;s genius gives the piece a sort of rhythmic tension which can be released at any moment. You also have McCoy&#39;s &quot;modal chord&quot; style of comping which gives the piece an almost &quot;dream like&quot; feel. Then you have Davis&#39; bass hook which is a real ear-worm. This sets the stage for the main soloists to show off their personality: Dorham sticks largely to the chord tones and stays inside, playing pretty phrases. In contrast Joe starts off well behaved but before long starts breaking out the wolf-notes and wild rollercoaster bop lines. The Henderson/Dorham partnership is something that will never get old, they just seemed to raise each other up every time they played together. . The one downside of &quot;In &#39;N Out&quot; is its brevity at just 5 tracks and around 38 minutes (reissues featuring an additional 9 minutes with an alternate take of the title track). In spite of this &quot;In &#39;N Out&quot; is an all time classic for me and one well worth your time to hunt down. .",

            "title": "Basra and Laura Nilva Paye",
            "content": "This week on the blog we are yet again visiting Plot Coffee Roasters - a near constant feature in the blog as of late. This time we have a rather neat competition winning lot from Peru. The lot is from Laura Nilva Paye located in the Puno department of the country. In terms of location this is the south easterly corner of Peru, close to the border with Bolivia. . The cultivar of this coffee is Bourbon. I have been reminded that my sloppy use of the word &quot;varietal&quot; is technically incorrect when referring to coffee. In layman&#39;s terms the difference between &quot;varietal&quot; and &quot;cultivar&quot; is the presence of human intervention - in coffee (essentially) all coffee plants have been selectively bred, hence they should be referred to as &quot;cultivar&quot; as opposed to &quot;varietal&quot;. This is something I often forget and end up referring to varietal but I&#39;ll try and be more precise in the future. . Plot label this coffee as a &quot;washed&quot; process, however looking into the details the coffee has been depulped and fermented for 20-24 hours before being washed. In that sense it is a little more &quot;honey&quot; than many washed coffees available. Following the washing stage the coffee is dried under shade. . Let&#39;s not hang around but get straight down to business: on the dry aroma I get sweet caramel and peaches, but they are very feint. Overall the coffee doesn&#39;t have a huge bouquet when compared to others, but it is very appealling I have a sense this will be a coffee I&#39;ll like. As I&#39;ve said before the dry aroma (or lack thereof) doesn&#39;t necessarily align with what ends up in the cup. . Into the filter; it is clear to see how much quality is in this cup. It is very clean and clear, every flavour is well defined. The first thing that hits me is the sweetness, it has a very sticky-sweet vibe like a really ripe peach or even a peach syrup. After the intial stone fruit hit subsides you&#39;re left with a stunning floral finish which is clean and long lasting. The notes from Plot say: &quot;a flavour profile more akin to Ethiopia than Peru&quot; and it is very hard to argue with that. In terms of acidity I would describe it as a medium, or it may be that all the sweetness just offsets it. Eitherway it is a very easy cup to drink but also has layers of complexity to keep you entertained. I find it&#39;s best enjoyed at a slightly cooler temperature, straight out of the brewer the flavours get a bit too muddled for my tastes. . Onto espresso: I found it basically impossible to get a bad shot out of this. You can basically pull it however you like, with any grind setting and it&#39;ll be great. I was without electricity for a day and even pulled a shot on my cafelat robot and it was perhaps the best shot I had. I love the robot as a manual espresso maker, but I struggle with the lighter filter roasts I favour for espresso because it is hard to keep the temperature high enough. No problem with this coffee though, it still extracted perfectly. I found most enjoyment pulling the shots a little shorter that 1:2 to get a more luxurious caramel mouthfeel. The flavour profile in the cup is pure condensed peach and apricot. It is like a shot of peach syrup, incredibly high sweetness, just enough balancing acidity and no harshness at all. As much as I enjoyed this coffee in a filter, for me it really shone as an espresso - up there with the best of the year so far. . On the jazz side this week we&#39;re heading back to a classic Blue Note recording from 1965 - &quot;Basra&quot; by Pete La Roca. . . Pete &quot;La Roca&quot; Sims is a drummer/percussionist - he is best known as a sideman having appeared alongside some of the all time greats: Sonny Rollins (Roca appeared albeit briefly on &quot;Live at the Vanguard&quot;), Joe Henderson (on &quot;Page One&quot;), Jackie McLean, Bill Evans, Sonny Clark and so on. He started his career however playing in latin bands, an influence that came through in his playing throughout his career. There are a few things interesting about Pete: firstly he despised the name &quot;La Roca&quot; - he came up with the moniker early in his career and it is how most people knew him, but he regretted it in later life. Secondly he was in some sense a &quot;part timer&quot; - throughout the 60s he made money as an NY taxi driver and later became a lawyer in the 70s returning to jazz just once after this. &quot;La Roca&quot; only has 3 albums under his own name, and one of those was erroniously labelled as a &quot;Chick Corea&quot; album by the record label initially. It&#39;s for that reason I consider &quot;Basra&quot; to be a bit of an &quot;under the radar classic&quot;. I&#39;m not a fan of labels like &quot;under the radar&quot; or &quot;underrated&quot; since they always bring out arguments of &quot;XXXX is less well known, so this isn&#39;t underrated&quot; eventually devolving into an excuse for showing how obscure ones musical tastes are. I consider &quot;Basra&quot; an &quot;under the radar classic&quot; however, because almost every &quot;experienced&quot; jazz fan I know loves the album but it will rarely (if ever) feature on a &quot;top 100 albums&quot; list and &quot;La Roca&quot; will never feature in a list of artists you &quot;have to hear&quot; - as a result this is an album that many do not discover until much later in their jazz journey. . So what makes the album so special? Firstly the line up: . Pete &quot;La Roca&quot; - Drums | Joe Henderson - Tenor Sax | Steve Swallow - Bass | Steve Kuhn - Piano As with many Blue Note recordings from around this time: a true heavyweight line-up. But more than that: &quot;Basra&quot; features some truly explorative playing. It is not your typical &quot;hard bop&quot; album, the is a darker brooding attitude and vibe throughout. The players also lean into the avant-garde/free styles more than many other albums of the period. But more than that there are influences outside of the typical &quot;jazz&quot; paradigm. | . This is perhaps most evident in the title track &quot;Basra&quot; (embedded at the start of the blog). A take on Middle Eastern classical music it is based around one chord and captures the &quot;meditative&quot; essence of the style. The &quot;blank canvas&quot; allows Joe to carve out any line he wants and it is some of the best lead playing you&#39;ll hear from Henderson. . There is also the firey &quot;Malaguena&quot; (above) which is a piece originally penned by Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona (again &quot;La Roca&quot; tipping his hat towards the latin music he played in his early career.) Again Joe plays out of his skin and there are plenty of &quot;Henderson-isms&quot; throughout which is no bad thing. The piece manages to be energetic without being high tempo, the quartet masterfully keeps racheting up the tension as it goes on but somehow manages to swing. &quot;Basra&quot; also features the original recording of the Swallow tune: &quot;Eiderdown&quot; which later went on to be a Swallow signature tune and a standard in its own right. It is interesting to hear it in its &quot;original&quot; form here. It is perhaps the most &quot;straight ahead&quot; of all the tunes on the album and Swallow&#39;s bass keeps the tune driving forward in his own inimitable way. This is also one of the recordings shortly before Steve switched to electric bass entirely, so it is nice to hear him play with an acoustic instrument. . All in all &quot;Basra&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the greatest recordings on Blue Note. Definitely hunt out a copy through whatever medium you use to consume your music. It is a shame we have so few records of &quot;La Roca&quot; under his own name, it would have been great to see where he would have taken his music. .",

            "title": "Sun Blowing and Morgon",
            "content": "This week we are back with another installment of the KaffeBox subscription. Recall the KaffeBox subscription highlights a different Scandinavian roaster each month. This month was particularly exciting for me since it featured one of my all time favourite roasters: Morgon Coffee Roasters - who I do not buy from nearly enough due to the logistics of getting the coffee here to London. The roastery is located in Gotherburg, Sweden. . The first thing that I noticed about Morgon is their aesthetic vision. Everything from their website, to instagram account to the bags themselves are really well put together. Each bag is blue in colour and features a picture depicting the flavour profile of the coffee inside. The images are really works of art in themselves, and this gives the impression of great quality even before opening the bag. As an example, here is an image from one of the bags we are looking at today: . . Certainly some of the best looking packaging out there in my mind. As with previous KaffeBox subscriptions I have 2 different 125g bags to play around with. This is not enough to dial in an espresso and make filter coffees with so I split the coffees - one for espresso duties and one for filter duties. This time I did it at random, when making the first filter coffee I just reached for a bag on the shelf and that&#39;s how it was assigned. Note that both coffees are &quot;filter&quot; roast. . Let&#39;s start with the filter option: we have a washed Ethiopian coffee from the Uraga Raro washing station located in the Guji zone - an area that crops up frequently on this blog. Morgon don&#39;t provide much more information than that, which is not a problem - we can move swiftly on to what matters: the coffee itself. On the dry aroma you get your &quot;typical&quot; washed Ethiopian qualities: citrus fruits and florals. As you would expect it is not a really punchy hard hitting coffee on the nose. In the cup you get everything you expect from a coffee like this: elegant earl-grey tea-like flavours, citrus-y blood orange and grapefruit sharpness and a very refined balance to the cup. This is just a top drawer example of what washed Ethiopian coffees are all about, there is so much clarity it allows the complexity to come through and allows you to enjoy the cup at the cooler temperatures. This is what I like and respect about the Morgon offerings I&#39;ve had in the past - they&#39;re just completely dependable. They seem to respect the origin and each one is a top quality example of what a particular region is all about. No nonsense, just really good quality. . On the espresso side we have a washed Caturra from Colombia - Ferney Cruz. Again not a whole lot of information here so we&#39;ll dive right in. On the nose I get hits of sweet &quot;red&quot; fruits like strawberry, raspberry and rhubarb, again it&#39;s not a big hitter but certainly enough to draw you in. Dialing this one in for espresso was a bit of a pain, this is a coffee where you need to set your grinder very fine. I was just past the point of burrs touching and I could just about wrestle a 1:2 in 27s sort of profile out of it. Being a filter roast however, it seems to benefit from a bit of a longer pull. 1:2.5 seems to work best in around 25s with the machine at full temperature. The resulting shot is syrupy sweet. The flavour profile is full of raspberry and rhubarb - if you imagine a pineapple cube sweet but made with rhubarb I don&#39;t think you&#39;d be far off the mark. Again the coffee is very clean, especially in the aftertaste - qualities I like in a coffee. Again it is just a very very good example of a clean washed coffee. . I was very happy to drink some more Morgon coffees this month, it reminds me that I should order from them more often. If you&#39;re after &quot;fireworks&quot;, crazy processing, loud punchy flavours - Morgon probably aren&#39;t the ones to go to (at least in my experience). But if you want complete quality and elegant clean cups Morgon are certainly up there with the best. . On the jazz side this week I found myself digging out an album from 2016 by the trio of Lars Danielsson, Marius Neset and Morten Lund on the ACT label - &quot;Sun Blowing&quot;. . . The story behind this album is that Danielsson, Neset and Lund met by chance on a train in 2012 - they had not met each other before, let alone played together. Two years after this happy accident they decided to record &quot;Sun Blowing&quot; - representing an &quot;intial encounter&quot; in the studio. The line-up here represents a &quot;tenor-sax-trio&quot; format with Neset on tenor, Danielsson on bass and Lund on drums. We have spoken about trio formats like this in the past on this blog - many sax players try and play in this context but few succeed. With so much space and freedom it really exposes the sax so you need to be on top of your game. Neset, however, is no ordinary sax player. A bit of a &quot;prodigy&quot; and one of the most accomplished young sax players out there. In contrast to his solo work which typically contains large ensembles, it is rare to see Neset play in such an intimate setting. Being a &quot;first encounter&quot; there is a lot of energy and vibrancy on show on the album. As you&#39;d expect from a trio of this format there is a big influence from the tenor greats: Coltrane, Rollins, Brecker, Henderson and so on. However there is also a lot of influence from the avant-garde and free sides too particularly from the early ECM records. While it would be easy to release an album of Neset just blowing over changes and showing off his chops, the guys here have worked on creating actual tunes. I think of Neset as a very thematic player, although he has chops his primary focus seems to be on creating themes and movements in the music. This gives his playing a &quot;story-telling&quot; sort of quality, this makes the tunes very memorable and they often stick in your head for days after hearing them. . The album kicks off with &quot;Little Jump&quot; (embedded at the start of this post), here Neset&#39;s playing is somewhere between Sonny Rollins and Michael Brecker. In the rhythm section Danielsson plays some of the grooviest, funkiest bass lines on the album and drives the tune forward. Behind it all however is Lund&#39;s modulating drum beat, he pulls and drags the time throughout masterfully. The interplay between Danielsson and Lund throughout is incredible also, it almost feels like a live gig with the energy flowing between the trio. . Another tune of note on the album is &quot;Up North&quot; (above), the main theme of which has a folk/Americana sort of vibe. This is an influence that comes up a few times throughout the album, this is even in reflected in the title of one of the pieces &quot;Folksong&quot;. On &quot;Up North&quot; there is more than a hint of Joe Henderson to Neset&#39;s playing - if you&#39;re familiar with this blog you&#39;ll know I see this as no bad thing. &quot;Sun Blowing&quot; is comprised entirely of original pieces apart from the Don Grolnick penned &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; (above) which closes the album. This is one of the lower tempo pieces on the album and it features some beautiful soloing from Danielsson. We are also treated to a masterclass from Lund who builds the energy just enough to punctuate the crescendo of each solo before bringing us back down again. . If you&#39;re looking for a jazz album you may have missed in the last decade, &quot;Sun Blowing&quot; is definitely worth your time. It&#39;s a little hard to believe this album is 5 years old (7 since it was recorded) - but it still sounds fresh. Given the energy and &quot;story-telling&quot; nature of the tunes it is an easy listen that does not require too much attention. Well worth hunting down a copy. .",

            "title": "The Colour of Intention and Finca La Esmeralda Gesha",
            "content": "This week we&#39;re heading back to the Brew Coffee Plus roasters in Streatham. For the second week in a row we&#39;re looking at a Gesha varietal coffee - but this time a washed processed example. We have talked about Gesha a few times in the past so we won&#39;t retread that ground - suffice to say the past few weeks of coffee have been relatively expensive so I might have to avoid the super-rare lots for a while! . I would be remiss if I did not first mention the packaging for this coffee. Since this is a special Gesha coffee, Brew Coffee Plus decided to pull out all the stops with the packaging. The coffee arrived in a thick cardboard box with a magnetic clasp, it reminds me more of a hardback book than it does a coffee box. Yes, it is superfluous and doesn&#39;t actually &quot;add&quot; anything to the coffee itself - but I&#39;m a firm believer that subconciously you judge a coffee long before it even reaches the cup and so this certainly does no harm. . The coffee itself is from Finca La Esmeralda in Acatenango, Chimaltenango, Guatemala. Seeing the words &quot;La Esmeralda&quot; and &quot;Gesha&quot; on the same page will likely make one think of &quot;Hacienda La Esmeralda&quot; in Panama - but this coffee is unrelated (aside from the obvious sharing of the Gesha varietal). There wasn&#39;t too much information provided with the coffee itself but it does state that the owner of the farm is one Mr Hermes and it provides an interesting tidbit that he is working with hybrid varietals. Potentially something to look out for in the future. . Let&#39;s dive into the coffee itself: in the usual way starting with the dry aroma. The first thing I notice is the nuance in the coffee. You can tell this will be a complex cup from the moment of opening the bag. There are layers upon layers of florals and citrus notes. It&#39;s quite hard to pinpoint individual notes here as there is a lot going on, but it is very inviting. . As a filter this coffee really shines. It is an incredibly clean cup of coffee, one of the cleanest I&#39;ve had in a while. The main two &quot;themes&quot; of flavour notes are citrus and florals. I would describe the citrus notes as being clemantine in terms of sweetness but with a grapefruit type acidity in their too. You could also argue various other citrus-y type notes too but those are the two that come to mind for me. Once the initial citrus hit subsides you&#39;re hit with a wave of florals - jasmines are certainly there and there&#39;s a certain honeysuckle type sticky sweetness on show too. The taste notes say &quot;bergamot&quot; which is also a good description. The cup is very complex so picking out a few taste notes is difficult. This cup is also super sensitive to temperature and it takes you on a journey when drinking it. Using any sort of temperature control mug would be a crime against coffee here. I would instead recommend getting a very thin walled drinking vessel so that it cools down quicker as it won&#39;t last long. . I had enough of this coffee that I could experiment with espresso too. It is a roast that is on the lighter end and has delicate floral taste notes which can sometimes lead to a difficult dialing in process. I found the coffee very forgiving however, most things seemed to work well. Ultimately though a longer shot of around 1:2.75 in about 25s worked best for me and the machine wanted to be as hot as it could go. Going too short with this one led to something too concentrated and it was hard to identify the flavours for me. The bit of extra liquid helped seperate the flavour notes - again a similar palette of flavours to the filter. . Another super enjoyable Gesha coffee and another good showing from Brew Coffee Plus. . On the jazz side this week we&#39;re looking at a 2020 release from Lewis Wright called &quot;The Colour of Intention&quot;. . . Lewis Wright is perhaps best known as being the vibraphone player in the UK jazz group &quot;Empirical&quot; - one of the more interesting UK jazz groups of the past few decades, playing music inspired by some of the free and avant garde artists as well as the more straight ahead. On &quot;The Colour of Intention&quot; however we get to see Wright in a more stripped down setting - he is joined by two fantastic musicians in the form of Matt Brewer on the bass (one of my favourite bassists) and Marcus Gilmore on the drums. With only a 2 piece rhythm section to support him we get to hear what Wright has to offer unencumbered. . On this outing there is less in the way of &quot;free&quot; playing than you&#39;d expect if you came here via &quot;Empirical&quot; - the majority on the playing is fairly &quot;inside&quot;. The one notable exception being the opening track &quot;Mettle&quot; (embedded at the start of the blog) which evokes Bobby Hutcherson on Eric Dolphy&#39;s &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; recording with it&#39;s circular repeating melody. What really stands out throughout the album is the sheer virtuosity of Wright. He has some really enviable chops, but does not let that get in the way of the music. You never get the impression that he is &quot;showing off&quot; or trying to impress anybody. This is particularly evident by the rather notable final track on the album: &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot;. For those unfamiliar: this is a piece by Thelonious Monk. It is known for being so complicated that the musicians on the recording (including Sonny Rollins) were unable to play it end to end without making mistakes, and to my knowledge Monk never performed this piece live in its entirety. By placing this track on an album you are certainly making a statement about your jazz chops. The arrangement is very cool too, it captures the vibe and the frequent tempo changes/rhythmic motifs but Wright manages to throw his own spin on the tune. . The problem with playing a relatively obscure instrument such as the vibraphone is you instantly get compared to those that came before. These days most will get compared to the late great Gary Burton given his reinvention of the instrument. While Wright is clearly influence by Burton (perhaps most notably on the track &quot;Resolve&quot; (above) which has a tinge of &quot;Crystal Silence&quot; to it.) Wright has his own sound and voice that is his own. Another track that really stands out for me is the beautiful &quot;Raise (For Z)&quot; (above) - it is not about high octane virtuosity at all and is the most stripped back on the album. I&#39;m particularly fond of Brewer&#39;s arco playing which is simply stunning, Wright makes sure to hold back during these parts to allow Brewer the chance to shine. Overall the piece has a dream-like almost meditative feeling to it and offers a stark contrast to the more uptempo numbers. . Overall &quot;The Colour of Intention&quot; is a really great modern jazz release. If you like small band interaction it is a shining example of what can be achieved. There is a near telepathic interplay between the trio and each one is trying to help the others thrive. .",

            "title": "The All Seeing Eye and Finca Hartmann Gesha",
            "content": "After a brief month hiatus the Plot Roasters ICON series subscription is back! Owing to Brexit related supply chain issues this coffee was due to be released in February but unfortunately got delayed until March. Let&#39;s see if good things do indeed come to those who wait. . As a reminder this is the 3rd installment of the ICON series by Plot Roasters. This series is a relatively expensive series of rare and exciting coffees, it&#39;s for those who love coffee and don&#39;t mind paying to get access to the rare lots. In this installment we have a Gesha varietal from Panama. In the past we&#39;ve talked about the rise of the Gesha varietal in the mid 2000s - and those with a good memory will recall that a particular lot from a Panamanian farm was responsible for causing the &quot;boom&quot;. It is therefore always interesting to get hold of some Gesha from Panama. . In this instance the Gesha was grown by the Hartmann family - one of the leading names in coffee in Panama, and their coffees always command high prices and achieve enviable cupping scores. The Hartmann family has owned farmland in Panama since the early 1900s, it now consists of many different coffee growing plots. The coffee we&#39;re talking about today is from the &quot;Roscosa Montana&quot; plot which translates to &quot;Rocky Mountain&quot; which borders the Parque Nacional de La Amistad rain forest. . The coffee itself has been naturally processed - dried on raised African beds for a full 25 days. . As with previous ICON installments this arrives in 150g bags only. As a result I don&#39;t use it for espresso since after a couple of shots to dial in I&#39;d be left with very little to enjoy at its best! So it&#39;s a filter only blog-post this week. I have been drinking a great espresso alongside this one but I&#39;ll feature it next time in a dedicated post. . Diving nose first into the dry aroma: the first thing to note is it smells incredible. The main hit is from tropical fruits, notably papaya and mango. But along with that there are caramel notes and a good floral bouquet. You can tell this is a very complex coffee before even taking a sip. Although it&#39;s a natural process there is not a hint of funkiness however, it seems very clean for a natural coffee. . Moving into the filter: this coffee is truly exquisite. The supply chain delays seem irrelevant on first sip - it is well worth the wait. The first wave of flavour that hits is the tropical fruit notes from the nose. Papaya and Mango are most prevalent but there is also a sharpness to it too, perhaps a passionfruit. But in the supporting cast I also noted down wild strawberries and I could even be argued into agreeing the sharpness has a raspberry quality. What is so interesting about this coffee however is that the floral notes stand up to these big tropical fruit notes - I get strong violet and lavendar vibes from this one. It is very very rare to find a coffee where the florals don&#39;t get overwhelmed by the bigger bolder flavours. This makes for a super interesting and complex cup. As the cup cools down the balance between the fruit and the floral changes, the cooler you go the more florals you pick up. This is a coffee that demands you to savour and watch the flavour profiles develop, drinking this in a temperature controlled ember mug would be an absolute travesty! . Yet again Plot have smashed it out of the park. Looking forward to see what is to come with future ICON releases. . On the jazz side we&#39;re going to look at another icon: Wayne Shorter with his 1966 release &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot;. . . At this point Wayne Shorter is certainly one of the elder-statesmen of jazz. Nearing in on his 90th birthday he has a career spanning around 70 years. During that time we has released solo works, been a member of both Art Blakey&#39;s Jazz Messengers (with whom he became the primary composer for the band) and Miles Davis&#39; band - along with being a founding member of one of the greatest fusion groups of all time in Weather Report. &quot;Star studded career&quot; isn&#39;t nearly enough to describe what Shorter has achieved. . At the very start of his career Shorter was seen as &quot;just another Coltrane tribute act&quot; - a label that (rather unfairly) was attributed to many tenor players of that era. As his career developed it was clear Wayne was anything but. Instead of relying on flashy, complicated, virtuosic playing (although he certainly had chops) - Shorter is now best known for his compositional voice. You can argue that he is one the greatest composers in all of jazz, if not all of music. His compostional style is focussed heavily on harmony, and using this to create a &quot;mood&quot;. A few albums before &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; he released perhaps his most famous album &quot;Speak No Evil&quot; where he explores the modal jazz style. Although his later works can&#39;t really be considered &quot;modal&quot; in the same way you can tell the modal style of creating a mood for a piece stuck with Shorter. &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; marks Wayne&#39;s 9th solo outing, and to date his most ambitious. From the get-go it is clear this is not your run of the mill bop record but something new entirely. It makes some nods from the avant-garde and free movements but the compositions are much more structured than is often the case in those styles. It is a highly ambitious record that still sounds daring today. . The opening title track (embedded at the start of this post) sets the tone for the rest of the record. In interviews Wayne has stated the entire album is an attempt to depict the meaning of life, creation and the nature of god. The solos on the title track thus represent &quot;the machinery involved in the process of creation&quot; - with other tracks on the album showing similar levels of symbolism. . Perhaps the most &quot;traditional&quot; bop-sounding track on the album is &quot;Chaos&quot; (above) - living up to its name it&#39;s a chaotic fire-breathing sort of piece which allows the stellar cast to flex their chops. The supporting cast on the album features: Freddie Hubbard on trumpet/flugelhorn, Grachan Moncur III on trombone, James Spaulding on alto, Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass and Joe Chambers on drums (with a cameo from Wayne&#39;s brother Alan on one piece). This is an enviable line-up of talent and the quality shows throughout, although the music is highly daring and experimental it never feels out of control. . &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; represents one of my favourite Wayne Shorter albums and it is well worth your time. It is likely music you&#39;ll have to put the effort in to appreciate however, and it commands your attention. But it is an album that will reward your effort so it&#39;s worth investigating. .",

            "title": "Body Talk and Villa Betvlia",
            "content": "This week we are welcoming a new coffee roaster to the blog: Brew Coffee Plus. Located in Streatham, South London - these guys have been on my radar for a while but I haven&#39;t got round to trying them. They tick a few boxes for things I typically look for in a roaster: a concise offering, focusing on quality over quantity. Plus their packaging is attractive but simple. You can read more about them on their website: https://brewcoffeeplus.com/ . This time I opted for one of their Colombian offerings - Villa Betvlia - a Caturra microlot that has been naturally processed. The farm is located in Huila, a &quot;hotspot&quot; for coffee within the country. The bag/website does not offer much in the way of back story behind this coffee, fitting with Brew Plus Coffee&#39;s minimalist aesthetic, so I don&#39;t really know much more about this coffee. So I guess we should just dive right in. . On the nose the first thing that hits you is big juicy tropical fruits. It is not a really intense &quot;fruit bomb&quot; aroma but more like a very nice tropical fruit salad. Although the tropical fruits hint towards natural processing methods you do not get the boozy/funky natural notes you often get. I also notice a caramel note in the supporting cast. Very appetising. In terms of roast level we are in a light range, but it is not super light/nordic by any means - not quite medium-light but getting there. . Moving swiftly onto the filter: again the over-arching flavour notes are tropical fruits. I get mango and pineapple most of all - the sweeter end of the tropical fruit range. There is also the passion fruit type acidity to matters but primarily I would say this is on the sweeter end rather than the acidic end. If you imagine a tropical fruit salad covered in a sugar-syrup you wouldn&#39;t be far off. The body and mouthfeel are in the medium sort of range, it is not completely absent but neither is it a coffee you need to chew. The aftertaste is fairly intense and lingering. Temperature wise I find this coffee is fairly linear - it has the same character hotter or cooler so it&#39;s one you can drink at your leisure. Overall it is not hugely complex but is certainly very drinkable. . As an espresso this might be one of the easiest coffees to dial in I&#39;ve experienced. It can take pretty much whatever I threw at it in terms of recipe. In the end I found that I liked a 1:2.1 ratio with a 7s pre-infuse followed with a 32-34s pull - on the temperature scale I&#39;m medium-high. This is not normally how I like to pull shots as it can introduce some bitterness or astringency to the finish but this is a coffee that can take it. You&#39;re rewarded with a thicker more luxurious shot and more intensity compared to my more usual longer/quicker style of pull. Again the tropical fruit salad and sugary sweetness comes through in the espresso, the acidity is slightly more noticable in the espresso but it is still a sweet coffee first and foremost. . Overall a very enjoyable coffee, hopefully a sign of things to come from this roaster and one I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be heading back to based on this showing. . For our jazz record this week we are heading back to 1973 and guitarist George Benson with his release: &quot;Body Talk&quot; on CTI records. . . If you are new to the world of jazz you might be surprised to see George Benson recommended on a jazz-blog. For many he will be synonymous with pop records such as &quot;Give Me The Night&quot; or his &quot;crooner&quot; image from his later works. It is easy to forget he has some serious jazz under his belt also. When he burst onto the scene in the 1960s he was considered a protege to Wes Montgomery in some respects. George&#39;s &quot;twin careers&quot; of jazz star and pop star came to a head a few years ago at a gig in London whereby he was unable to sing so played a set of instrumental jazz pieces and the (non-jazz) crowd booed him for not playing his &quot;hits&quot; - a rather embarrassing incident for the London live music scene and those involved should be ashamed. &quot;Body Talk&quot; is one of my favourite Benson albums. It marks a kind of &quot;cross-over&quot; period from the more straight ahead jazz he was playing before and the RnB and pop influenced music that came after. I wish he spent a bit more time exploring this soul-jazz kind of space as he was very good at it. On this album Benson entrusted James Brown alumni - saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis to write and arrange a few of the tunes. But it is clear that the James Brown DNA heavily influenced Benson at the time since all the tracks feature the strong grooves we associate with Brown. . The album also features some heavyweight jazz icons in the supporting cast: Jack DeJohnette taking control of the drumming duties - one of the most prolific jazz drummers of all time. Jack manages to introduce a slight swing to proceedings while keeping the muscular grooves driving forward, something that is not easy to do by any means. Alongside is Ron Carter on the acoustic bass (the album also features Gary King on electric bass). We&#39;ve spoken about Ron in the blog before, as a bass player he is completely reliable and can throw his hand at anything - another jazz legend. On the electric piano we also have Harold Mabern. He is one of the underappreciated greats, a lot of his work has been as a sideman rather than a leader. I was fortunate enough to be able to meet him before he passed away - a great musician and a great person. I&#39;ll save my Harold story for another day when we can focus on him. . The album kicks off with &quot;Dance&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) and straight away gets into a deep groove. You can tell that Benson had an eye on making music you can move to here, it&#39;s almost impossible to not tap your foot along to the beat. However, it features an absolutely virtuousic guitar performance throughout. I consider Benson as one of the most naturally gifted guitar players of all time. There appears to be absolutely no filter between brain and guitar, it comes across as completely effortless. This is backed up by watching some of his incomprehensible guitar tuition videos - it is so natural he is completely unable to effectively explain what he does. . Another track that is particularly interesting on the album is the third number: &quot;Plum&quot; (above). This really exemplifies the two worlds of jazz and RnB that Benson is trying to straddle. It starts off in a swinging jazz tune but eventually the horns and percussion come in, the groove hits and we&#39;re comfortably in foot-tapping mode again. This is not a jarring experience of slamming two styles together - the transition is seamless. Again Benson throws out some mindblowing guitar lines as all this is unfolding. Perhaps the hardest hitting groove is the title track &quot;Body Talk&quot; (above). Here we have a piece that is part James Brown groove and part Latin jazz. It&#39;s 8 minutes of pure energy and intensity. While there is incredible musicianship on display, the main theme is itself catchy and something you&#39;ll likely be humming to yourself after hearing it. . &quot;Body Talk&quot; is a bit of an underappreciated jazz album, from his &quot;jazz&quot; period other Benson albums such as &quot;Beyond Blue Horizon&quot; often get more publicity - but for me &quot;Body Talk&quot; is where Benson hits his stride. If you do not know anything of George Benson&#39;s jazz career I&#39;d strongly suggest giving it a listen. .",

            "title": "Sonny Side Up and Arnoldo Perez Hydro Natural",
            "content": "This week we&#39;re heading back to Plot Coffee Roasting again. A few blog posts ago we featured the rather special Champagne yeast processed coffee from Finca La Senda in Guatemala - this time we feature another experimental processed coffee from the very same farm. As before the coffee is of the Pache varietal. . The process is described as a &quot;hydro-natrual&quot; - the cherries are picked and dried in the sun for 4 days before being soaked in water overnight. This &quot;rehydrates&quot; the cherries which are then dried in the shade for another 28-30 days. The folks at Finca La Senda are certainly experimental and they should be commended for it. I think processing variation is likely to be the key to unlocking new flavour potential in coffee. Of course genetic diversity of coffee plants can lead to variation but this is a slow process driven by evolution (aside from the rare &quot;freak discovery&quot; of an unknown varietal) - processing is something that has a shorter feedback loop and so is a more commercially viable for the farmer. . I have to admit however I&#39;m not a fan of all the experimental processings I&#39;ve had. In fact I have a rather low hit rate of enjoyment from them, I often find them unbalanced or just plain odd. Based on the Champagne yeast processed coffee I have high hopes for this one however. . Lets just dive straight into the coffee itself. Like the Champagne yeast offering Plot have opted for a pretty light roast, maybe a hair darker than the Champagne yeast but I never compared them side by side. On the dry aroma it is clear this is a very different beast. The first thing that I notice is the red berry note - it also has a sort of bramble note too, it reminds me of a fruit picking farm. In the background there is just a hint of tropical fruit, but it is not your typical &quot;fruit bomb&quot;. . As usual we start with a filter brew: just as on the nose the primary thing I notice is the red berry flavours. The label lists blueberry and raspberry, which I don&#39;t disagree with. The tropical fruit flavours are also more prominent in the cup, mango being the predominant note. On the acidity scale this one comes in quite high but it is balanced with a lot of sweetness. It also has quite a big mouthfeel and body. Interestingly I find this coffee is better at higher cup temperatures, usually I find the flavours difficult to distinguish at the higher temperatures but this coffee keeps its clarity. At lower cup temperatures the acidity can take over a bit. . Moving onto espresso: as you&#39;d expect for a light roast the machine temp is set to maximum. For a ratio I found 1:2.5 works best but I prefered to pull a bit slower than usual at around 30-32s. This allowed more of the body to come through and added some intensity to the shot. I didn&#39;t find this added any bitterness at all and everything balanced nicely. The flavour profile was much the same as the filter brew: mangos and raspberries. Despite being a fairly acidic light roast it is surprisingly easy to drink as an espresso and one I have enjoyed. The only downside to the espresso compared to the filter is less of the complexity comes through. . Overall another great offering. For me the Champagne yeast version was more up my street, but I could easily see others having the opposite preference. Drinking two coffees from the same farm with different processings is always interesting as you can see what a huge difference there is in the cup. These coffees are night and day different, in a blind tasting I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to identify they were from the same farm. Plot offer a third processing from Finca La Senda (carbonic maceration) but unfortunately at the time I couldn&#39;t justify getting all three since I already had too much coffee to be getting on with. If it&#39;s still available next time I do a Plot order I&#39;ll pick up a bag. . On the jazz side this week we&#39;re heading back to an all time classic from 1957. The seminal &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; from Dizzy Gillespie. . . Dizzy has featured on the blog in the past as a co-headliner but this is his first showing in his own right. Dizzy of course needs no introduction - one of the forefathers of be-bop, he is one of the few jazz artists who became known outside of the jazz community. Potentially down to his look: often sporting a beret, horn-rimmed glasses and of course the puffed out cheeks when playing. Or possibly down to his jovial and light hearted personality. But, there is no doubting his musical pedigree. By 1957 be-bop had pretty much run its course, it had become fairly &quot;mainstream&quot; in jazz by then so just playing be-bop was not enough to gain recognition. Jazz artists were beginning to look at the new &quot;post-bop&quot; world and where they could make their mark. For somebody like Dizzy who was one of the originators this could present a problem, it is often easy for an artist to get stuck in their stylistic box and unable to adapt with the times. To combat this Dizzy apointed two tenor saxophonists to help him out: Sonny Stitt and Sonny Rollins. . Besides just providing am easy pun for the album&#39;s title the tenor pair provided the necessary artistic direction for the album. Both Sonny&#39;s were clearly disciples of Gillespie&#39;s buddy Charlie Parker - but instead of simply copying Bird licks they each developed upon the Parker framework in different ways. Stitt was most directly compared to Parker, originally playing alto he was often labelled a &quot;Parker Clone&quot;. To combat this he made the switch to the tenor and developed a more forceful approach, however he still adopted the belly-fire of Parker and made use of the wild lines we associate with be-bop. In contrast Rollins adapted the Parker ethos in a different way, he made use of the be-bop framework but explored thematic and motif led ideas. You could argue it is more of an intellectual approach, often adopting more complex harmonic devices and crafting lines that fall further from typical be-bop. Hearing the two tenor-men back-to-back is part of the joy of this album. You could never mistake one for the other since their styles are so different (although I believe one version of the liner notes did just that, stating that a Rollins solo appears first or vice versa) Yet both players serve the music being played and neither sounds out of place. . With three titans in Gillespie, Rollins and Stitt - it would be easy to overlook the rest of the band: Ray Bryant on piano, Tommy Bryant on bass and Charlie Persip on drums. While these guys may not be &quot;headline acts&quot; as the others they do add to the quality of the album - so many albums featuring &quot;heavyweights&quot; fall down with poor supporting casts. This is particularly true for an album such as &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; where you have two tenor players battling each other for supremacy, the rhythm section needs to be tight and stay out of their way and that is certainly achieved here. . &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot; is afterall however a Dizzy Gillespie album so it is worth exploring a little bit of his role. The album is itself essentially a &quot;live&quot; studio album, all tracks were recorded in one take in a &quot;cutting session&quot; style. Reportedly before the date Dizzy did his best to rile up the rivalry between the Sonny&#39;s - important work to get the best out of the band. This all came to a head in the stand out tenor-duel on the track &quot;Eternal Triangle&quot;. For me this is Dizzy Gillespie&#39;s true talent: getting the best out of people. I do not believe Charlie Parker would have been nearly as revered as he is today without Gillespie. Dizzy worked out a lot of the harmonic complexities of be-bop which allowed Parker (and to a lesser extent Monk) to flourish. Dizzy is of course no slouch on the trumpet either, this is particularly clear on his killer solo on &quot;After Hours&quot;. He manages to pull of an effortlessly cool and laidback blues led solo. Not something you instantly think of when you think of a Dizzy solo. Then of course you cannot ignore the trademark Gillespie humour and wit - on this album coming through in the opening track &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;. Here Gillespie completely reworks the standard both melodically and rhythmically to create a fresh take on a well-trodden classic. We also get to hear Dizzy stretch his vocal chords which is always intresting too. I can see many parallels between his vocal phrasing on this tune and the phrasing used in rap music. . The downside to this album is its brevity - clocking in at just over 30 minutes. It would have been great to have another cut or two on the album but it doesen&#39;t take away from the enjoyment. For the jazz historians and those interested in the progression of be-bop it is a very interesting recording, but it is also a great listen for those that just want to hear a great old-fashioned cutting session. .",

            "title": "Landmarks and Clever Coffee",
            "content": "This blog post marks a return to my KaffeBox subscription. This time it features a pair of coffees from Danish coffee roaster Clever Coffee. Not to be confused with the &quot;clever dripper&quot; brewer manufactured by a totally different company. I have to admit I&#39;d never heard of Clever Coffee prior to receiving these coffees, part of the joy of a subscription service like KaffeBox. . Packaging wise they opt for quite a minimalist aesthetic with plain white packages and green labels. For each coffee there is a different shade of green so I assume they might have other colours for other coffees. Overall I don&#39;t mind the presentation but it is not as eye-catching as some other packaging I&#39;ve seen. . As with the previous KaffeBox offerings I received 2 bags of 125g each, I decide to dedicate one to filter and one to espresso so I have a chance to dial in and get the best out of them. This time I decided which coffee to use for each preparation completely at random - it was whichever I picked up first when brewing the first filter coffee. . On the filter side this week we have La Catarata - a red catuai varietal from Costa Rica. The processing method is described as &quot;black honey&quot; - I&#39;ve covered honey processing in previous posts so won&#39;t retread old ground there. But the &quot;black&quot; designation is used to refer to the amount of fruit/mucilage left on the seed as part of the honey process. Very loosely: a white honey means that a lot of the cherry is removed (&quot;closer to a washed&quot;) and black honey means more cherry is left attached (&quot;closer to a natural&quot;). . The first thing to notice about this coffee is that it&#39;s certainly on the lighter end roast wise. On the dry aroma I get hints of caramel and honey along with a fig fruity note. It has a heft to the nose but it is not something you&#39;ll smell across a room when somebody opens the bag. In the cup the first thing to note is how balanced the cup is; acidity and sweetness are in perfect harmony. In terms of flavours I get apples and caramels most of all. You get the crisp sharpness of a green apple followed by the sweetness of the caramel. In terms of body I would describe this as a medium, given the roast level it has more body that you would expect. The aftertaste is very clean and fairly short lived. It is not the most complex coffee you&#39;ll ever drink and you don&#39;t really get anything in the way of progression as the cup cools. It is a very reliable no-nonsense sort of cup. . On the espresso side we have Fazenda Samambaia - a Mundo Novo varietal from Brazil. What is interesting here is that it is an anaerobically processed coffee, I don&#39;t remember seeing many Brazilian coffees with this processing method. However, Brazil is not an origin I spend much time with typically. On opening the bag again I notice the light roast level and on the nose I get caramel notes but overall it is a pretty subtle affair. . In terms of dialing this coffee in I have to admit it was a bit of a challenge (this is a light filter roast so that is not a complaint). This coffee is prone to getting a bit acidic so to combat that I had to set the machine to maximum temperature. Pulling the shot long helped with this also but the coffee has a great body that is sacrificed so I preferred to keep it more in the 1:2.5 range. When it&#39;s right it is fantastic and super interesting. I would describe the sensation as being like those traditional pineapple cube sweets - that sort of tropical fruit note combined with huge sweetness. I find that the mouthfeel starts off kind of thin but the body &quot;blooms&quot; and you&#39;re left satisfied. If you don&#39;t have it dialed in or your puck prep is not quite right you do end up with a &quot;battery acid&quot; shot however. This is one for somebody experienced at making espresso and doesn&#39;t mind a bit of work, but you will be rewarded for it in the end. . For this weeks jazz we&#39;re jumping back to 2014 with Brian Blade and The Fellowship Band and their Landmarks recording. . . Landmarks is the fourth release from The Fellowship Band having released their debut album in 1998. The heart of the band features Brian Blade on drums, Jon Cowherd on piano, Myron Walden on alto sax and bass clarinet, Melvin Butler on soprano and tenor sax and Chris Thomas on bass. They also feature the occassional &quot;guest&quot; spots notably in the guitarist spot - on this album we have Marvin Sewell and Jeff Parker who replace Kurt Rosenwinkel Drummer Brian Blade is of course the &quot;headline act&quot; for this band and, arguably, the most famous musician on the recording. He is perhaps best known as a sideman and particularly through being &quot;Wayne Shorter&#39;s drummer&quot; for many years. He has also been a long time member of the Chick Corea trio and has appeared alongside more modern greats such as Joshua Redman and Kenny Garrett, as well as appearing on Joni Mitchell records. . Brian&#39;s drumming style is both interesting and distinctive. A big part of his vibe is his use of dynamics when playing, it is very musical and makes everybody he plays with sound better. I have to say that live this comes at a cost however. I have seen him live a few times where he has ruined the gig by not playing the room correctly. The drastic change in dynamics can become jarring and quite distracting in my experience. But on record and on dates where the room can support his style he is incredible however and few can compare. . Of all the Fellowship records Landmarks has long been my favourite of the lot. I feel that at this point the band is so familiar with each other that they are completely free to express themselves. The record prior to this one are great and I still enjoy listening to them, but as a complete statement Landmarks is where they nail it. While taking a nod to jazz artists that come before them the Fellowship band really thrives at bringing in elements from Gospel and American Folk like lyricism. It is more about an overall atmopshere and feeling than it is technicality, each member adds texture upon texture to create a landscape. This is an album where it&#39;s best to just let it wash over you, and it may take a few listens to truly appreciate it. . Selecting tracks on an album like this is difficult as I feel it&#39;s best to listen from start to finish. At the start of this post I embedded the title track &quot;Landmarks&quot; which features a bass led folk-like motif as its main theme. There is a spiritual quality to the piece with it almost feeling like a hymn. The interplay between Blade and Walden is also a particular highlight. &quot;He Died Fighting&quot; (embedded above) in contrast features a rootsy bluesy theme driven by Cowherd&#39;s piano followed by some gutsy blues influenced soloing. While the soloists clearly exhibit virtuosic ability that is not what is important here, the focus is always on the tune - the band is almost completely devoid of ego which is part of the magic. The album closes with the shorter piece &quot;Embers&quot; (above) based around a country-like theme but featuring gospel-like sensibilities. . Overall Landmarks represents a truly original and fresh take on modern jazz. It takes influence from the past but is not beholden to it while not trying to be modern for the sake of it. The Fellowship Band have created a sonic universe that is all their own hopefully we will see many more releases from them. .",

            "content": "This week we are heading back to the fine folks at Plot Coffee Roasting ( https://plotroasting.com/ ) - now a near permanent fixture on the blog. Plot are consistently crushing it lately with great coffee after great coffee, definitely check them out if you have not already. . This time we have a super interesting one, and possibly a first for me. The coffee is from a farm &quot;Finca la Senda&quot; located within the Acatenango region of Guatemala. In the past few years I&#39;ve noticed the quality of Guatemalan coffee has increased exponentially, I&#39;ve had some really special coffees from there. What makes this coffee particularly interesting is the &quot;yeast maceration&quot; processing method. Here Pache varietals are picked and the whole cherries are placed under carbonic maceration for 30 hours. Following this a specific strain of Champagne yeast is added to the mix and maceration continues for a further 36 hours, before being sun-dried for 30 days. This is a fairly long processing time which gives plenty of opportunity for complex flavours to develop. The introduction of a Champagne yeast is new to me - at least I can&#39;t remember trying a yeasted coffee before (but I try many so I may have simply forgtten). . Let&#39;s just get down to business. On the dry aroma I don&#39;t get a huge bouquet, it is fairly quiet and refined in its presentation. There are fruity notes most notably orange and some delicate floral type notes but they&#39;re subtle. As I&#39;ve stated many times in the past a lack of &quot;punch&quot; here does not always translate into the cup. . Using my tried and tested filter recipe the first word that comes to mind for me is: Exceptional. This is an incredibly refined cup, I feel as though I should be sat in a tuxedo to do the coffee justice. The main flavour notes are oranges and citrus fruits. The mouthfeel is a little sticky and the slight floral hint gives the impression of elderflower or honeysuckle. What is really mindblowing however is the finish which is exactly like Champagne. You don&#39;t notice it initially but after the initial hit of flavour and particularly in the aftertaste you get that unmistakable Champagne drying quality and a really strong white grape punch. It is also super sensitive to temperature and it really evolves as the cup cools. I find it best on the cooler side of things as it allows the more delicate notes to pop. . Moving onto the espresso: this coffee is definitely on the lighter side roast-wise so I was expecting a bit of a battle to get the best out of it (especially with the delicate flavour profile) - but it was a joy to dial in. I found it next to impossible to get a bad shot out of it - the only caveat being the machine needs to be blinding hot, too cold and some sourness creeps in. In the end I decided on a 1:2.25 ratio, this seemed to better preseve a silky mouthfeel that is otherwise lost. Going longer didn&#39;t increase the sweetness for me. The flavour profile is similar to the filter and that Champagne finish becomes even more intense. . As both filter and espresso this coffee was fantastic and one I&#39;m going to sorely miss. It may only be February but I feel this is a contender for &quot;coffee of the year&quot;. . On the jazz side this week I had intended to talk about a specific album, but on Thursday the jazz-world was shocked at news of the passing of Armando &quot;Chick&quot; Corea. So instead I thought I&#39;d share my Chick stories. . . The word &quot;legend&quot; gets thrown around quite a lot these days, but Chick is one of the few truly deserving of that title. His career started in the mid 1960s working with the likes of Stan Getz, Blue Mitchell and Herbie Mann. His &quot;big break&quot; however came when he joined the Miles Davis band and was instrumental in driving the &quot;fusion&quot; sound that Davis was chasing at the time. After the stint with Davis he started another fusion group: &quot;Return to Forever&quot; - one of the most successful fusion groups of all time. In addition to rock he brought inspiration from Latin-American music (something he also visited in solo album &quot;My Spanish Heart&quot;). He also formed the &quot;Chick Corea Elektric Band&quot; - a fusion supergroup with legions of fans and the offshoot &quot;Akoustic Band&quot; where they dropped the electric instruments in favour of acoustic instruments. Subsequent to this Chick spent a lot of his career doing more traditional projects until the formation of another fusion group &quot;Five Peace Band&quot; with John McLaughlin, Kenny Garrett, Christian McBride and Vinnie Colaiuta. Chick Corea is one of the few artists who can span any decade and any style - you can essentially pick up any one of his records and have a good time. . I was never fortunate enough to meet Chick personally, but over the past 10 years or so I have seen him live countless times in many different contexts. One of the things you notice walking out of a Chick Corea gig is his warmth towards everybody. I remember one instance where he was playing a solo gig and the venue staff were keeping the doors closed while he was playing, only letting people get to their seats between tunes. Chick addressed this and said: &quot;what&#39;s going on? This is not a classical recital, let people come in and out as they want&quot; - there are not many artists around who would express such a sentiment. . Then of course there is his use of the audience as a &quot;piano&quot; - whereby he&#39;d get different sections of the audience each to sing a different note to create a chord to accompany his playing. This is something that others have tried but it usually feels uncomfortable and gimmicky, with Chick&#39;s enthusiasm and humour it totally works. . Another time I saw him in a trio context with Christian McBride on bass and Brian Blade on drums. To date one of the best gigs I have ever seen. It came across that they didn&#39;t even have a set list they just decided what they were going to play on the spot and the mood take them wherever they wanted to go. I&#39;m sure there was a setlist or at least a shortlist to choose from, but the carefree energy added to an already amazing show. During this one I remember distinctly them playing &quot;Work&quot; by Thelonious Monk. People often talk about Chick in terms of raw technique and crazy knowledge of harmony - but he more than anybody understands what Monk is all about. He managed to capture all of the nuance from Monk - the feel, time and even captured the mannerisms often getting up from the piano and walking around during others solos. It was truly a joy to behold. I also remember attending the Elektric band reunion concert where they played the entire first album. All the guys recognised that the 80s synth sounds are a bit dated now so they had some fun with it. Chick even broke out the keytar a few times in true 80s style. Even though the synth sounds are not particularly popular today looking past that some of the music on that album still stands the test of time. . There was also the duet concert I saw between Chick and Herbie Hancock a couple of years ago. Even in his 70s Chick was still sprightly and energetic. He played some really daring music that night and one of the things I remember clearly is just seeing Herbie with a grin from ear to ear the entire time. . In losing Chick we lost one of the few remaining artists from a golden era. A master, a genius, whatever superlative you wish to throw around Chick was all of those things. Right til the end he was still touring and playing some of the best jazz gigs you could ever see. He will be truly missed. RIP Chick. .",

            "title": "Quiet and Kafferäven Per Nordby",
            "content": "On the blog this week we are looking at the second installment of my Kaffebox subscription. The previous months coffees were delayed significantly due to various issues and so the coffees featured in this post arrived only a few days after those - a much better result as I can review the coffee fresh as intended! As I&#39;m writing this blog the next months Kaffebox arrived so I expect those to feature in the not too distant future also. . The featured roaster this week is: Kafferäven Per Nordby. A Swedish roaster located in Gothenburg - another new one to me. The packaging is clean and monotone which suits my aesthetic. They have included brew recipes for both filter and espresso on the reverse of the packaging so I can only assume this is an omniroast coffee. You can read more about them at www.kafferaven.se . As with the previous Kaffebox subscription I have 2 different 125g bags to play with. This time I decided to dedicate one to filter and one to espresso, I feel this is the best option as it gives me a few chances to dial in the espresso. If I tried to make espresso and filter with each coffee I wouldn&#39;t have many attempts to dial in and I feel that would be unfair. I decided which was which based on origin/taste notes that I prefer in one method over the other. . Let&#39;s start with the &quot;filter&quot; coffee. It is a honey processed coffee from Costa Rica called Senel Campos. Honey Costa Ricans have long been a favourite of mine, early in my coffee journey I had one from Hasbean coffee roasters that blew my mind and is one of the reasons I went further down the coffee rabbit hole. This particular example is made up entirely of the Catuai varietal. . On the dry aroma I get 2 distinct notes: caramel and apple. While not an absolute monster in terms of sillage, it is strong and punchy. This is especially true when grinding where the caramel became very noticable. In the cup the flavour notes are much the same for me: caramel and apple. Imagine biting into a toffee apple made with a very sharp green apple, that is the best description of how this coffee behaves in filter. There is quite a lot of sweetness but also quite a lot of acidity that cuts through, in the aftertaste it comes through as a sharp citrus kind of quality. This keeps the aftertaste very clean which is something I always look for. There is just enough body in the coffee to hold the flavour notes together. But interestingly, and this is going to sound a bit nuts, I find the body is mostly present in the aftertaste. When you&#39;re drinking the coffee you don&#39;t really notice the body but it reveals itself afterwards. This is not a quality I&#39;ve noticed before in a coffee but it is something I&#39;ll be on the lookout for as it&#39;s kind of neat. . The &quot;espresso&quot; coffee is called El Avion, it hails from Nicaragua. It is a washed Caturra varietal. I decided to go for this one for espresso due to the flavour notes mentioning chocolates and nuts which I find tend to come out better in espresso based drinks. I typically find honey processed coffees the easiest to dial in though so it was a bit of a toss up between them. . The dry aroma of this coffee doesn&#39;t hit quite as hard as the Senel Campos. The main note I get is a hazelnut and not much else. It&#39;s important not to place too much emphasis on dry aroma because that doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to the cup. As mentioned before on the bag there are brew recipes, here they recommend a 1:2.5 ratio in 32-35s. I am not a fan of having brew recipes for espresso on the bag, there is such a wide variety of machines and grinders out there it kind of becomes meaningless. Throw in differences in water, ability of the barista and it&#39;s clear you should follow your senses instead of the bag. Further, typically the same &quot;recipe&quot; is printed for every coffee offered by a roaster - it is unlikely each coffee will yield best results with the same recipe. This is not a moan aimed at Kafferäven but the industry more widely - we need to get better at communicating these things. . Onto the espresso itself: I found this one very easy to dial in. I tried the bag recommendation initially and it was OK, but for me it had a little too much bitterness in the finish. I found the best results at around 1:2.2 in around 22-25s. Temperature wise it worked best at a medium temperature, this coffee seems very easy to extract and so very easily finds itself in over-extracted territory. When dialled in it makes great espresso. It has an unctuous body and mouthfeel like thick milkshake. The toasted hazelnut note comes to the forefront but is paired with quite a delicate floral backdrop - it is something I only noticed when I really focussed on tasting. It is not a distracting complexity, just something that&#39;s there if you look at it. As with the filter, the coffee is super clean - with this one I found the aftertaste was very shortlived but intense. . Another 2 great coffees from Kaffebox. If I had to pick a &quot;winner&quot; (not that they&#39;re in competition) I would go for the Costa Rican as it&#39;s just more &quot;my&quot; sort of coffee. I favour the crisper acidic coffees most of all. You can&#39;t go wrong with either however. . On the jazz side this week we&#39;re hanging out with John Scofield and his 1996 album &quot;Quiet&quot;. . . John needs no introduction, he is rightly considered one of the biggest names in jazz today. His gigs remain extremely popular and he can sell out large venues the world over at the drop of a hat. He started his career in the late &#39;70s where he worked with names such as Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan, Charles Mingus, Billy Cobham, Dave Liebman, Joe Henderson and was with the Miles Davis band for many years (as well as many other interesting projects). Alongside this he released his first solo album in the late 70s before getting &quot;big&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s - success that carries over to the present day. What set John Scofield apart in the early days was his ability to blend the &quot;rock&quot; distorted electric guitar sound in a jazz context. Others may have been a few years earlier in doing this, but most got the tone all wrong - sounding like a bad teenage cover band. Sco was one of the first to really nail the tone and he acted as the blueprint for many others that followed. For most of his career the main signal chain hasn&#39;t changed significantly: an Ibanez AR semi-hollow (similar to a 335) into a dirt pedal (typically a rat) into a Vox AC30. This allowed him to do the rocky numbers but also clean up and give a convincing clean jazz sound too. During the &#39;80s like many he went down the processed chorus drenched sound but thankfully he didn&#39;t stick with that for too long. In the &#39;90s he became known for being one of the first to blend jazz with electronic music and hip-hop (at least with commercial success). A true innovator and maverick in the jazz-world. . The album today, however, is &quot;Quiet&quot; - this is an oddball in the Scofield back catalogue because he plays acoustic guitars exclusively. As a result it gets overlooked, his bigger &quot;hits&quot; like &quot;A Go Go&quot; with MMW, &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;, &quot;Uberjam&quot; and so on get all the acolades. These albums are of course fantastic but I find &quot;Quiet&quot; one of the best examples of Sco&#39;s compositional ability. I hope he releases a few more acoustic albums in the future. . What is really magical about John&#39;s playing is his rhythmic ability and feel. With many jazz artists you can &quot;cop&quot; their style relatively easily. I don&#39;t hear many who do the &quot;Sco&quot; thing well, you only need to hear a split second of him playing and you are 100% certain it is him. I have read a description that &quot;John knows so much music that it just seems to ooze out of him every time he plays&quot; - which I think is the perfect description (I can&#39;t remember who came up with this description but full credit goes to them). Back to the album itself. In addition to featuring acoustic guitars it also features a larger ensemble cast with rich horn arrangements throughout. In addition to featuring regular band mates: Steve Swallow on the bass and Bill Stewart on the drums if also features a wider cast of (the legendary) Wayne Shorter and Randy Brecker. In total there are 12 musicians on show, this allows John to create really rich and interesting arrangements. I think it&#39;s safe to say that Wayne Shorter had a big impact on this release as some of the arrangments have a &quot;Shorter&quot; kind of feel to them. . This album is largely about the orchestration and feel so it&#39;s not really about iconic &quot;moments&quot; or individual tunes. Throughout this post I have added some choice tunes but really this is an album that is best enjoyed from start to finish, just set it playing and let the moods wash over you. If you&#39;re a Sco fan but haven&#39;t heard this one, or you&#39;re just intrigued by the concept it&#39;s well worth hunting down a copy. . For the particularly keen: Jazz Night In America broadcast a gig by John celebrating both &quot;Quiet&quot; and another album of his &quot;Loud Jazz&quot; (1987). It is broken into a &quot;Quiet&quot; section and a &quot;Loud&quot; section and is also worth a watch. A link to the gig on YouTube can be seen below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-bWt4rZrA8 .",

            "content": "This week on the blog we are taking a trip back to Bath and Round Hill Roastery. These folks require no introduction having featured multiple times on the blog and are a firm favourite at JazzCoffeeStuff HQ. . This time we have a bit of an interesting coffee. It is from El Salvador and is called &quot;Las Cruces&quot; which is the name of the mill where the coffee is processed. As with most El Salvador coffees this is a Bourbon varietal, where things get interesting however is the processing. This coffee uses a &quot;honey anaerobic&quot; method. Cherries are picked and then dry fermented anaerobically for 72 hours, they are then pulped and allowed to dry on raised beds where they are turned fairly infrequently to allow the flavours to develop. They also produce a version of this coffee that is &quot;natural anaerobic&quot; where the cherries are not pulped before drying. In theory the honey anaerobic should produce a slighlty cleaner cup. . El Salvador is an origin I tend to favour but I have never seen an anaerobic process used there so I was very interested in giving this one a go. As usual I opt for filter roast. . Diving straight in: on the dry aroma I am greeted with warm baking type spices such as ginger, nutmeg and cinnanom. This is paired with a brown sugar sweetness and caramel sort of note and a slight nuttiness. On first impressions not the wild ride you&#39;d typically expect from an anaerobic coffee. . As a filter I noticed a few things; firstly this coffee does not enjoy high brew temperatures. Usually I like to leave my kettle hot as I find that works best for the sort of coffees I go for. This translates through to the cup too where it really comes alive as it cools. On the palette I get get an initial hit of tropical fruit, the bag notes say this is banana but I&#39;ve never had much success in finding these &quot;banana&quot; notes in coffees. This descriptor seems to have sprung up in the past year or so out of nowhere. For me I&#39;d describe it as a mango or papaya, it is not a big punchy tropical fruit bomb but it is there. The brown sugar and hazlenut sort of note in the nose also shows itself after the initial tropical hit. In the finish there is a grape-like sharpness that lingers for quite a while. In terms of body I would describe this as a medium to high (for the sorts of coffee I usually drink), sweetness is medium and acidity is medium also. It is not the cleanest cup I&#39;ve ever had but that is expected with an anaerobic, but neither is it too funky. I&#39;ve enjoyed this as a filter, especially when I&#39;ve let it cool down. Drinking it at a higher temperature causes the flavours to &quot;bunch up&quot; and it&#39;s hard to differentiate the notes - some may enjoy that visceral sensation but I prefer flavour definition. . This coffee as a filter was a bit of a difficult one. There is not a large sweetspot on this coffee and it took a bit of work to dial in (the espresso roast version is likely easier). As with the filter it doesn&#39;t like getting too hot so I kept my machine temperature around the middle of the range. I ended up pulling a quick shot (~20s) but a typical ratio (1:2) for the best results. I wanted it shorter to emphasise the body of the coffee but going for a more traditional time (~30s) and things started to get a bit muddy, pulling quicker cleaned things up a bit. The flavour profile is essentially the same as in the filter, but the real gem is the thick unctuous mouthfeel. The baking spices on the nose really come out in the espresso as well as the brown sugar. It is almost like drinking cake batter. As with the filter there is a lingering sharp grape-like finish to the cup. . Overall an interesting cup. A little different to the usual coffees I go for but very well done. I&#39;d say this is more of a coffee for the curious than those wanting an easy day to day drinker. . On the jazz side we&#39;re heading back to the late &#39;90s with the Kenny Garrett classic: Songbook. . . It has been a busy week at JazzCoffeeStuff HQ this week, in such circumstances I hunt out dependable albums that I know won&#39;t disappoint - it is not a time for finding new music. &quot;Songbook&quot; is an album I&#39;ve listened to start to finish countless times over the years and it is an all time favourite of mine. . Kenny first made his way onto the scene in the mid 1980s, with his first solo album being released in 1984. He also joined Art Blakey&#39;s Jazz Messengers in 1986 - a true badge of honour for any up and coming jazz musician. In these early days he was rooted in the post-bop or hard-bop camp. While the early recordings are a great introduction to the man, it wasn&#39;t until the early to mid-90s that Kenny really found his sound. Pretty much any Kenny Garrett album from the &#39;90s is a classic and worth hunting down. My favourite, and likely his most successful, is &quot;Songbook&quot; from 1997. . Following the meteoric rise of Coltrane the tenor sax became &quot;the&quot; sax instrument of choice for improvisers. Despite Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker&#39;s unquestionable influence on jazz the alto sax has been pushed to the sidelines by the deeper registered tenor. Kenny Garrett is one of the few who really keeps the alto alive and well. The choice of instrument has clearly had an impact on his musicality too, while he has the Coltrane chops (and has released a tribute album to the man) Kenny often favours the chirpier more staccato style of playing to the fluid legato. . What really sets Kenny&#39;s playing apart from the crowd however is the influence of asian music. While he doesn&#39;t go fully down the rabbit-hole of microtones he clearly takes a lot of inspiration from east-Asia specifically. On Songbook these influences are there but in the later albums the Asian influences come to the forefront - listening to the albums in order you can really hear the progression of these ideas. Another part of the Garrett magic is his ability to craft really simple and catchy melodies and weave them into more complex jazz pieces. This is something that was a big part of jazz until perhaps the 1970s where complexity took over and the newer generation of players wanted to push the boundaries of technicality and harmony. During the &#39;90s certain artists such as Kenny Garrett and Christian McBride tried tp buck this trend and used simple melodies as a tool within their music. This is probably most evident in his &quot;hit&quot; - &quot;Happy People&quot; that forms part of just about every setlist he plays. . This brings us to perhaps what I associate most with Kenny Garrett: his amazing live performances. I believe he is consistently one of the greatest live performers around today. I have seen him countless times and I can only remember one gig where he wasn&#39;t fantastic - on that occassion he was staring daggers at the sound guy so was clearly not happy with something. But even that &quot;less than perfect&quot; gig was still a great evening. If you get a chance his performances are well worth the price of admission and I try and catch him every time he is in town. . &quot;Songbook&quot; consists of 10 Garrett originals, perhaps the best known is &quot;Sing a Song of Song&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) that has become a mainstay of his setlists ever since. It is a relatively simple melody which adds to its lasting appeal, but it also forms a good &quot;blank canvas&quot; for improvisation since it is essentially just a modal piece. The album recording also features a killer Garrett solo that takes us just far enough outside to keep you on your toes but at the same time respects the tune. There are also the pieces &quot;Brother Hubbard&quot; and &quot;Ms Baja&quot; in a similar vein which have also become fan favourites and tunes he often revisits live. . The album is more than a &quot;one-trick-pony&quot; however, it also features some serious hard-bop chops. Perhaps the best example of this is the opening track &quot;2 Down &amp; 1 Across&quot; (embedded above). Here Kenny channels his inner Coltrane and goes hell for leather and presents a masterclass in post-bop soloing. It is not just Garrett who deserves a shout-out here with pianist Kenny Kirkland, drummer Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts and bassist Nat Reeves providing not only the perfect rhythm section but soloing in their own right. I&#39;ve often said on this blog that one of the biggest tests for improvising jazz musicians is the ballad. It is often difficult to strike the balance between respecting the tune and keeping the music interesting. &quot;Songbook&quot; contains a number of great ballads. The most popular is likely to be &quot;Before it&#39;s Time to Say Goodbye&quot; - a tune Garrett penned for his former employer Miles Davis. However &quot;She Waits for the New Sun&quot; is the ballad that always sticks in my mind from this album. It captures a pensive and contemplative mood and evokes a feeling of shuffling round the New York backstreets in autumn. . For any jazz fan &quot;Songbook&quot; is essential listening, especially if you&#39;re accustomed to listening to the &quot;classics&quot; and rarely stray past the 1960s in your record collection. In around 60 minutes of music there is not one second of &quot;filler&quot; on this album and it&#39;s likely to be one you&#39;ll forver come back to. .",

            "title": "State of the Tenor and Love Coffee",
            "content": "This week on the blog we make use of my brand new KaffeBox subscription. For those that do not know KaffeBox are based in Norway and do a subscription service sourcing coffees from the best roasters in Scandanavia. You can read more about them here! Unfortunately due to the christmas period, Covid lockdowns and Brexit delays these coffees arrived to me a little late (roast date 26th November) - so I&#39;m taking this in mind in this review. While the 8 or so weeks is not very old for a coffee (especially for a light filter roast) the flavours might pop a little more if I&#39;d had them a little earlier. And to be perfectly clear, this is not KaffeBox&#39;s fault. . The coffee themselves is from a roaster in Lund, Sweden called &quot;Love Coffee&quot;. This roaster is completely new to me, I have never tried their coffee before (at least I can&#39;t remember if I have). The first thing that strikes me is the packaging, which is very nice. The bag features a black and white cartoon of a coffee shop on the front and a roaster on the back. It&#39;s always nice to see roasters put some effort into their packaging designs. . Credit: https://www.instagram.com/lovecoffeelund . In this case I recieved 2 smaller 125g bags of coffee: one being a washed Colombian &#39;La Esperanza&#39; and a natural Ethiopian &#39;Buku&#39;. These are very &quot;classic&quot; origins and processing methods so a good introduction to a new roaster. I used both of these coffees as espresso exclusively (as I was using last week&#39;s Plot ICON as my filter alongside them) - so filter fans will need to wait until next week for their fix. . Let&#39;s start with the Colombian La Esperanza. The farm is located in Nariño, Colobmbia - a location I&#39;m not overly familiar with. It is a washed coffee that is made up of at least 70% of the &quot;yellow Colombia&quot; varietal - as the name suggests a yellow cherry fruit. I can&#39;t really find much more information on this one so let&#39;s dive straight into the espresso. . As is often the case on this blog we are making espresso with &quot;filter&quot; roasts which tend to be quite light. This can often make the dialing in process fiddly. However, in this case it was very easy. The coffee was extremely forgiving with my setup. I found that it actually liked to be around a 1:2 ratio with a fairly ordinary recipe. This accentuates the natural body and mouthfeel in this coffee and is more pleasant to drink. In the flavour notes I got a very nutty quality underlying some top notes of a sweet red apple. The sweetness is fairly high and the acidity muted in this one. This is the sort of coffee that is a pleasure to drink, you don&#39;t have to think about it too muich and it just leaves you satisfied. . Next we have the Ethiopian Buku. This coffee takes its name from the washing station where the coffee was processed. The station is located in the Guji zone in the southern part of the country - an area very familiar to those who have read some of my previous postings. The varietals are listed as &quot;heirloom&quot; which is something we have covered in the past so I will not re-tread old ground. . This one was not quite as easy to dial in as the Colombian, but it was not particularly difficult either. Pulling the shots too short introduced a bit of harshness in the finish so I pulled slightly longer to around 1:2.25 in the end. There is plenty of natural sweetness and the acidity is not too high so there was not a huge benefit in pulling any longer than this. This coffee absolutely loves high temperatures though and I had to set my machine to its hottest setting for optimal results. This results in an intensely perfumed cup, I get strong notes of lavendar and bergamot first and foremost. This is combined with the &quot;bruised blueberry&quot; note you often get with a natural Guji. On the funk-o-meter it is fairly low however, it is refined and fairly clean tasting. There is some body in the cup but it is not a &quot;huge&quot; coffee. I found this coffee really enjoyable, these highly perfumed coffees are my favourite ones to use as an espresso so this one was a lot of fun, I wish I had a bit more of it. . Overall a strong showing from Love Coffee, a roaster I&#39;ll certainly keep an eye out for in the future. . On the jazz side this week I have been listening to the live double album from Joe Henderson: &quot;State of the Tenor&quot; recorded at the Village Vanguard in 1985 and released in 1986 on Blue Note Records. . . Originally this album was released as 2 seperate LPs: &quot;State of the Tenor Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;State of the Tenor Vol. 2&quot; - but subsequently were combined into a double LP. There are so many stellar tunes on this album perhaps I could have seperated them. . In the mid 80s jazz was in a bit of a funny place. At this point fusion was really the &quot;hip&quot; thing to be playing (although that trend in itself was coming to an end) and playing more straight ahead was considered a bit dull and boring. I consider &quot;State of the Tenor&quot; to be Joe throwing down the gauntlet and showing just how creative you can be with a basic acoustic trio of: tenor, bass and drums. The original liner notes to the album states that the recorded concerts were effectivly &quot;saxaphone lessons&quot; owing to the sheer number of sax players in attendence. I am a huge Joe Henderson fan, I make no apologies about this. He features regularly on this blog as a result. For me he is, perhaps, the greatest improviser of all time. Some players can play flashier more complicated lines and others may play with a bigger rounder sax sound but Joe captures &quot;something&quot; when he&#39;s improvising. In terms of lineage he is clearly in the Sonny Rollins school first and foremost, their playing is quite similar in many regards (even the trio format on this album is something you could link back to Rollins). But Joe takes it a step further, he will stray further &quot;outside&quot; than Rollins ever will. Not only will he play outside harmony we will stray outside in his timing also. His &quot;natural&quot; rhythmic device is to lead the band, it almost feels as if he is pulling the other band members along at times. For effect he&#39;ll also play really loose and instinctively, the timing of his lines doesn&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; in the true sense but it works because of the overall mood he manages to create. . Then of course we have Henderson&#39;s virtuosity. John Coltrane is often a name synonymous with tenor virtuosity, he plays incredibly fast and harmonically complicated lines (at least before his modal/spiritual journey). These lines all fall relatively comfortably under the fingers however, it still requires immense practice to play that way but the lines usually feel &quot;comfortable&quot;. In contrast some of the lines Joe plays are hideous under the fingers, for anybody but Joe they feel wrong and unintuitive. He might not (often) reach Coltrane&#39;s break neck speeds but I argue these lines are way more difficult to play, especially the way Joe does with the odd note groupings and accents. You sometimes here others try and play &quot;Henderson licks&quot; but they are never that convincing nor sound as fluid as Joe. . The album itself features a combination of Henderson originals and standards by the likes of Parker, Silver, Mingus and Ellington. The album opens with &quot;Beatrice&quot; penned by Sam Rivers (embedded at the start of this post). Continuing the theme of &quot;jazz education&quot; I&#39;ve always felt that this take was a heavy influence on some of the current crop of tenor players; most notably JD Allen - on many of his albums I notice bass/sax interplay that always makes me think of this take. . It is also worth noting the rest of the cast on this album. On the bass we have Ron Carter - even trying to summarise his recorded output would take up multiple blog posts. Not much more needs to be said about Ron, definitely a legend and one of the greatest bass players in the history of jazz. Rounding out the line-up is Al Foster on drums - again somebody who has played with just about anybody you care to mention. Overall an absolutely incredible line-up for a trio format, it would have been great to hear this band live. . The second track I picked for this post is &quot;Boo Boo&#39;s Birthday&quot; - a piece penned by Thelonious Monk (embedded above). Thelonious is clearly a big influence for Joe, his sense of timing can certainly be described as &quot;Monk-like&quot;. Of course, he also has the tune &quot;Isotope&quot; (originally on &quot;Inner Urge&quot; but a version also appears on this album) which he describes as a tribute to Monk. I find Monk tunes a great canvas for improvisers, the tunes are often very playful which helps the musicians relax. Jazz improvisation is often seen as very &quot;serious&quot; so it&#39;s nice to hear musicians having fun from time to time. Of course Monk&#39;s arrangements also tend to be quite spacious which allows for more experimentation. The last tune I want to highlight from this album (although they&#39;re all stellar) is the Henderson penned: &quot;Y Ya La Quiero&quot; (above). Continuing the theme of education and influence: to me it is clear to see how this influence Kenny Garrett in quite a profound way. When this was recorded Kenny would have just been starting his career and had not quite yet found his signature sound. His early to mid 90s sound is very reminiscent of this &quot;Y Ya La Quiero&quot; and I am always reminded of Kenny when this tune plays. As a Henderson tune it is a bit of an outlier, it is not what you would consider a &quot;typical&quot; arrangement for him which makes it quite a nice addition to this album. . As with most albums on this blog you really cannot go wrong with this one. My only slight complaint is that on some releases of this album the sound is all over the show, some tunes quiet some tunes really loud. I don&#39;t know exactly which releases are the ones to avoid (the &quot;bad&quot; version I had was on a CD) but it&#39;s worth keeping in mind. .",

            "content": "This week we are back looking at a very special coffee. Last month you may have remembered the Yemeni coffee from Plot Coffee Roasting - this was the first in a new coffee &quot;series&quot; called &quot;Icon&quot; offered by Plot. The idea being that the coffees offered represent the &quot;best of the best&quot; and some of the rarest coffees available. This week we have the second offering in this series. . This time the coffeee comers courtesy of Finca Monteblanco in Huila, Colombia. Huila is a relatively small department within Colombia located in the south-west region of the country. As a coffee producer Huila certainly punches above its weight however and you don&#39;t have to search very hard to find specialty coffee from the region. The farm is owned by Rodrigo Sanchez Valencia who inherited the farm from his grandfather. . There are two main areas of interest with this coffee: firstly the varietal is our old friend Gesha. The gesha varietal has appeared on the blog multiple times, it is currently the &quot;goose that lays golden eggs&quot; for specialty coffee. Simply having a Gesha coffee can leads to very high prices owing to the demand for the varietal. Whether this is a good thing or not is debatable. You may recall from previous blogs that you can trace the lineage of the Gesha back to Ethiopia, however its recently popularity is due to a farm called Hacienda La Esmeralda. In this case Rodrigo received Gesha seeds from a client in Panama which led to this weeks coffee. . The second area of interest for this coffee is the processing method. This method is the brainchild of Finca Monteblanco and has taken around 5 years to perfect. It is described as a &quot;cold fermentation&quot; process. The main steps of the process (after initial sorting) is to depulp the coffee and store them in bags within a temperature-stable cold room for 76 hours. The remaining pulp is then washed off and then the coffee dries for a total of 28 days. In terms of processing this is certianly a slow and relatively laborious method. By keeping the temperature low Rodrigo is able to control the fermentation and not let things get too funky, yet still allow flavour complexity to develop. Of course a process such as this increases the price of the coffee substaintially. To those new to specialty coffee (and even those well versed) - the price of the Icon series of coffees may seem excessive, but a huge amount of work goes into these coffees. . Let&#39;s dive into the coffee proper: on the nose I don&#39;t get a huge hit of aroma. This is somewhat expected, Gesha varietals tend to be fairly polite and tend not to be flavour bombs. What you do notice though is sweet and stickly florals such as honeysuckle. Visually this coffee is roasted pretty light, as you&#39;d want for a coffee like this - a heavy roast could mask the natural flavours. . As a filter this coffee makes an extremely elegant and refined cup. The first thing I noticed is just how clean the cup is, I usually buy cleaner tasting coffees but this is next level. The flavour profile is fairly muted, as you would expect with a Gesha. However there is a lot of complexity there, the main flavour notes for me are honeysuckle and white florals. Alongside delicate melon fruit like sweetness. As the cup cools the florals become more and more present and the aftertaste lingers that little bit longer. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this being served cold, but it certainly likes being drunk at a lower temperature than most. Since the cup is so clean you can get away with the lower temperature without getting too much bitterness. Overall the cup is very balanced erring slightly towards the sweeter side rather than the acidic side. There is not a big body or particularly big mouthfeel to the coffee but there is a certain &quot;stickyness&quot; to it which is very pleasant. . As always with these high-end coffees that only come in &quot;small bags&quot; I did not intend to use them for espresso. With 150g of coffee you get very few chances to dial in, especially if you&#39;re also making filter coffees with them. This week however I did use these beans to make 1 espresso - purely by accident, I picked up the wrong bag after a long Zoom meeting when I was fairly tired. The coffee I had dialed in was also a Colombian to a similar roast level so it was not a million miles away but I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to talk about this coffee too much as an espresso after one showing. The flavour notes were largely the same as with the filter, with no real suprises (other than my shock when I realised I&#39;d used the wrong bag for espresso!) . Overall another great Icon - looking forward to see what part 3 brings. . Since we are looking at a coffee Icon it seems only fair to pair this with a jazz icon. In this case the 1966 album from Larry Young on Blue Note Records: Unity. . . An absolutely iconic album from the Blue Note archives. Unity is possibly my favourite album cover of all the Blue Note album artwork - which is saying something when pretty much every one is a classic. Stylistically it is perfect, bold but not overbearing, simple but not boring. Even today this album cover does not look &quot;dated&quot;, it is hard to believe the artwork is now over 50 years old. This just goes to show what a genius Reid Miles was, without his contributions Blue Note may not have been the success it is today. Not only is the music fantastic and recorded well - the overall package and feel of these Blue Note records makes them feel special... Even if, in his own words, Reid Miles &quot;hated jazz&quot;. . Let&#39;s start with a roll call of artists who appear on Unity: . Larry Young – Hammond B-3 organ | Woody Shaw – Trumpet | Joe Henderson – Tenor saxophone | Elvin Jones – Drums | . From this alone you can see why this album is deserving of the &quot;Icon&quot; status I&#39;ve given it. Truly an all-star cast - even at the time without the benefit of knowing what these guys did after Unity was released. We can also see that the line-up, interestingly, does not feature a bass player. This is very important for the sound and overall vibe of the album. Larry has to essentially take on the lower-frequency responsibility - often playing a strong groove to drive the music forward. This creates a rather large amount of space in the mix for the soloists. As a result the music is very experimental and ground-breaking. There are clear nods towards the free-jazz movement of Ornette, the post-bop work of Coltrane and the modal explorations of Davis - and I do not make comparisons to those artists lightly. The use of organs in jazz has always been a bit of a contentious issue for some. The likes of Jimmy Smith and the soul-jazz kind of style heavily rooted in the blues can come across as a bit cornball for some. If this is a sentiment you share Unity is probably the best antidote. While the music is clearly centered around Young&#39;s organ sound, it couldn&#39;t be further from the soul-jazz sound. . The album kicks off with a piece penned by trumpet player Shaw called &quot;Zoltan&quot; (embedded at the start of the post). Interestingly enough; the lead artist Young does not have a single writing credit on the album. Zoltan starts off using the march from a Hungarian opera by Zoltán Kodály (no prizes for guessing the inspiration for the name of the piece). Soon after it descends into an exploration of the Lydian mode. The highlight of the tune for me is the incredible solo by Joe Henderson. Here he is at his best, playing &quot;just outside&quot; - it is not quite inside but neither is it full on free, at his best Joe finds that balance perfectly. If you&#39;re a fan of Joe&#39;s records Inner Urge, Mode for You or In &#39;n&#39; Out you&#39;ll likely recognise some of the licks here. . Speaking of Joe, he also has a writing credit here with the tune &quot;If&quot; (above). This is the most hard-bop-y of all the tunes featured and is a typical Blue Note recording. It is perhaps the most simple tune and closest thing to &quot;straight ahead&quot;. Of course Elvin and Joe have played together many times and so have a near telepathic relationship. They keep the music driving forward and swinging hard, Elvin is in his absolute element here and shows why he is one of the all-time drumming greats. The use of an organ and no bass makes this piece particularly special however. Ordinarily you would expect the band to be rounded out with bass and piano, again the extra space allows the soloists complete freedom in where to go. The album closes with &quot;Beyond All Limits&quot; another piece penned by Shaw. Harmonically it is the most complicated on the album and features some absolutely mind bending lines. Creating any sort of solo at all over these changes is difficult enough but Henderson, Shaw and Young make it sound easy. You can really hear each soloists personality shine through here: Larry Young&#39;s solo to cap off the tune is probably the highlight - as with any good solo he takes what others have played before him and expands upon it, making sure it builds to a crescendo. . Selecting just a few tracks from this album is difficult, every one is worthy of comment. We did not even touch on the 2 standards featured: Thelonious Monk&#39;s &quot;Monk&#39;s Dream&quot; and Hammerstein&#39;s &quot;Softly as a Morning Sunrise&quot;. I feel like I say this every week but it is especially relevant this week: this is an album worth hunting down and exploring in detail. . This blog post marks a bit of a milestone for jazz featuring on the blog. A few weeks ago I decided to start a Spotify playlist featuring all the music featured on this blog (you can find it here!) With the tunes in this blog post this playlist now has over 100 tunes and over 12 hours of music. .",

            "content": "This week we are heading back to Brixton&#39;s finest: Assembly Coffee roasters. They are regular features on the blog for good reason, it is generally hard to pick a coffee any less than great from them. I&#39;m sure they will crop up on the blog many times during 2021. . The coffee this week is from Guatemala. Surprisingly this is the first coffee from Guatemala to feature on the blog so far. I tend to find Guatemala to be a reliable origin and one I enjoy coming back to. I tend to find them to be extremely balanced and very easy to work with. They&#39;re not necessarily associated with the &quot;big&quot; flavours or &quot;wild&quot; tasting notes, but you don&#39;t always want that in a coffee. In the past few years I&#39;ve noticed the quality of Guatemalan coffees going from strength to strength and hopefully they&#39;ll continue to. . The coffee in question is a washed processed orange bourbon. Orange bourbon is a natural hybrid between the red and yellow bourbon varieties - so named because of the colour of the coffee cherries. I consider the bourbon varietal to be the &quot;old reliable&quot; of the coffee world. There are newer sexier varietals that command the higher prices and esteem but I will always find myself going back to bourbons from time to time. Unfortunately bourbon is very suceptible to leaf rust and other diseases and pests, as a result many bourbon plants have been replaced by other varietals that are more robust in this regard. . Diving straight into the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I get a caramel note and a faint hint of a fruitiness. It is not powerful on the nose however, it is not one that will blow your socks off. As I&#39;ve noted previously this does not necessarily translate to flavours in the cup however. . As usual we start with a filter coffee. The first word that comes to mind with this coffee is &quot;balanced&quot;. The acidity and sweetness is just so perfectly balanced, you have enough acidity to keep things interesting but it is not high acidity by any means. It is actually very easy to drink. In terms of flavour notes I think a crisp green apple is the best description. Assembly use the descriptors: &quot;Lemon Curd and Orange Zest&quot; - I can see what they&#39;re getting at with the brightness in the cup but for me it is more like biting into an apple. The sweetness takes the form of a caramel for me - perhaps even a toffee apple. There is a certain amount of mouthfeel and body to the cup, but it is more syrupy than heavy. My one slight negative about the cup is it doesn&#39;t cool down well for me, this is one you want to drink quite hot. However, it is so drinkable you&#39;ll unlikely have a cup sit around long enough to get to that level. . Moving onto the espresso. The first thing to note is this one is an absolute dream to dial in, the sweet spot is huge and it&#39;s very difficult to go too far wrong. The roast level is fairly light but not excessively so, which I think helps the dialing in. I found that a standard 1:2 and 27s (after 7s pre-infuse) was about right to keep enough of the syrupy body. Given the balance of the coffee going longer doesn&#39;t help balance things out anymore. Going shorter to ristretto sort of levels can be nice but I found that the flavours get a little too muddled and I preferred the clarity in the standard ratio. One caveat however is the temperature: this coffee liked my machine to be essentially as hot as it could go. Dropping the temperature led to a slight sourness in the aftertaste which I didn&#39;t care for. When made in this way the shot was syrupy, balanced with just the right amount of acidity coming through. As with the filter crisp green apple and caramel were my main flavour notes. . Overall another solid showing from the folks at Assembly, worth picking up a bag if these flavour notes are speaking to you. . On the jazz side I have been listening to the fantastic live album (recorded in Toronto 1975) by the late great Jim Hall. . . I have been a guitar player since I was around 11 years old, however I have never been a huge fan of many jazz guitarists. Most of the time I&#39;d rather listen to horn, trumpet or piano players. There are a few jazz guitarists who had a profound effect on me however and Jim Hall is certainly in that list. I picked up this album relatively early in my jazz journey and I remember not being particularly moved by it at the time, however as my ear has grown over the years it is one I keep finding myself coming back to. Jim started his career in the Chico Hamilton quintet during the mid 1950s before moving on to Jimmy Giuffre&#39;s band. The rest of his side-man resume reads like a who&#39;s-who of the jazz world featuring names such as Paul Desmond, Art Farmer, Bill Evans, Sonny Stitt, Stan Getz, Lee Konitz and countless others. He is perhaps best known, however, for his work with Sonny Rollins. In particular the album: &quot;The Bridge&quot; which was the first to appear after Sonny&#39;s hiatus and featured the new &quot;piano-less&quot; format for the Rollins group. &quot;The Bridge&quot; changed everything in terms of jazz guitar, it acted as a blueprint for jazz guitar comping for decades after it and went to show that the guitar could functionally replace the piano in a group. Any jazz guitar player owes a great deal of gratitude for Jim Hall for doing this, without him later players such as Pat Metheny, John Scofield and Bill Frisell would unlikely be drawing the attention they do. . The album in question today: &quot;Live!&quot; was recorded in 1975 when Jim was already a well established name and at the top of is game. It was recorded in Toronto&#39;s Bourbon Street Jazz Club - fitting given we looked at an orange bourbon coffee varietal this week. It features Don Thompson on bass and Terry Clarke on drums. Much of Jim&#39;s playing is about band interaction, his play essentially &quot;reflects&quot; the ideas of whoever he is playing with back to them. This allows every member to sound &quot;more like themselves&quot; and raises the music to a higher level. This is something that I feel had a profound effect on Bill Frisell who&#39;s playing has a similar quality in a more modern setting. . The album itself is entirely made up of standards. The playing of familiar tunes allows the trio to really explore the music freely and express themselves. A lot of the exploration takes place in the subtlties, while it&#39;s possible to listen to this album without paying much attention it really rewards those looking deeper. You can hear each band member picking up on the phrasing of each others lines. Jim&#39;s sparse comping style is on full display in such a stripped back environment. You can also hear his use of dynamics, something that a lot of jazz guitar players overlook. . Being a live album of course there are imperfections: you can hear the audience clinking their glasses in places and there are some notes that I imagine would have been &quot;fixed&quot; on a studio release. However more than most other live albums I can think of it really captures the feeling of a small jazz club. If you&#39;ve not heard Jim Hall or this album before I strongly suggest finding a copy. For the particularly keen you can also find &quot;Live vol 2-4&quot; which is essentially an extension of this album and features additional music recorded at Bourbon Street. .",

            "content": "Welcome to the first JazzCoffeeStuff blog post of2021. Usually the new year is the time for people to turn over a new leaf, try something new or make a life change. At JazzCoffeeStuff we are not doing this: we are once again featuring a blog favourite: Assembly Coffee Roasters - with a coffee of theirs hailing from Ethiopia. And of course served with a side of jazz. . Assembly have featured on this blog multiple times in the past - I always list them as one of my favourite UK based roasters and always find myself coming back to them. They have made a small change to their presentation however in removing the roast date and replacing it by a &quot;Best Before&quot; (which is 12 months after roast) - which personally I am not a fan of. I would prefer to see the roast date itself and a &quot;best before&quot; for me would be 3 months at most. For the seasoned coffee person the best before date doesn&#39;t really matter, but for those getting into specialty it might be a bit misleading and prevent them getting the most from their coffee. This is the most minor of gripes however and does not stop me buying from them. . Onto the coffee itself: what drew me to this particular coffee was the list of varietals: Setami, Mikicho, 72/158, 74/110. I&#39;m glad that Ethiopian coffees are slowly but surely beginning to discover the varietals that constitute &quot;Heirloom&quot;. In this instance this list of varietals does not help me too much as I have no experience with any of them (by name) - but it forms a &quot;first data point&quot; in understanding them. Hopefully I can get my hands on some more in the future. The processing method is washed and the coffee is called: Shantawene - after the village where the wet mill is located and this coffee is made up of produce from multiple smallholders. . Moving swiftly on to what matters: on the dry aroma I get a hit of a caramel and a crisp green apple. Alongside is a heavier fruit note: a date or prune. It is quite a fragrant coffee, often washed Ethiopians can be quite mellow and restrained but that does not seem to be the case here. . This week my filter coffee process had to be adjusted slightly: I have been unable to locate my usual chemex filter papers so I am using boxed Hario filters instead. These papers are (much) thinner than the chemex, this has the effect of allowing more of the coffee oils to get through - this increases body and sacrifices a bit of clarity. Which you prefer is personal preference, as long as you make sure you buy the correct Hario filters: the Holland based factory does not produce good filters at all. The boxed filters are the best of the lot (they have 3 different factories) and so I only bother with those. You can make a &quot;faux-chemex&quot; by double bagging the Hario filters but it is not quite the same. . Through an act of serendipity the changed filters actually work well with this particular coffee. There is a lot of texture and mouthfeel on show and the Hario filters amplify this. The body is very big and it is certainly a heavy hitter, not what I was expecting at all to be honest. In the Assembly tasting notes they describe this as &quot;concentrated&quot; which is fair, personally &quot;intense&quot; is one of the first words I wrote down. I think &quot;intense&quot; fits better with my experience because of the absolute punch this coffee gives. The overarching flavour is blackcurrant, it has a sort of Kenyan vibe to it but without the excess acidity. As an Ethiopian you also get the usual peach/apricot flavours coming through too. The florals are less than you might expect but they do pop out in the long lingering aftertaste. . As an espresso this coffee really shines for me. The thick viscous mouthfeel is really amplified through this method and you end up with a big and punchy shot. Despite the (very) light roast level of this coffee I ended up with a very traditional: 1:2 in 30s type profile at a medium heat. This seemed to highlight the viscosity and massive mouthfeel. I tried going even shorter to ristretto type levels to boost this even more but this seemed to introduce a little harshness in the finish which I didn&#39;t care for. Flavour wise it is all about the blackcurrant and stone fruit - it&#39;s almost like one of those &quot;superfood shots&quot; you can get at trendy smoothie bars. . Overall a great start to coffee in 2021, if you can I&#39;d recommend picking up a bag. . On the jazz side this week I dug out an old fusion record from 1975 courtesy of The Brecker Brothers with their (semi)eponymous &quot;The Brecker Bros.&quot; album. . . Fusion records are not something I listen to particularly often. There are plenty of albums and artists I love in that style but I often struggle with the recording styles, tones and production values. Many of these records end up sounding pretty dated today. Unfortunately this record is one of them, however it is well worth battling through as the music is top draw. It is particularly worth a listen if Snarky Puppy were your gateway into the murky world of jazz since The Brecker Brothers were certainly a big influence in developing the Snarky sound. . As their name suggests The Brecker Brothers consist of brothers: Randy and Michael Brecker. Those with good memories may remember that Michael Brecker featured on the blog previously as a sideman on the Pat Metheny album 80/81. Michael was best known for his virtousity and ability to play extremely complicated fast lines with complete precision, this is on full display on this album. The opening track &quot;Some Skunk Funk&quot; (embedded at the start of the blog) is a prime example of this, although he doesn&#39;t quite reach the dizzying diminished, whole-tone scale wizardry of some of his later recordings. The track &quot;Rocks&quot; (below) is another that Michael Brecker highlight. While he never had quite the &quot;star power&quot; of his brother it&#39;s important not to overlook Randy Brecker too. In addition to the Brecker Brothers records (where I feel he was the main driving force to be honest, these records have a very different vibe to Michael&#39;s solo work) Randy has a number of solo records under his belt and has appeared alongside many of the greats such as George Benson, Jaco Pastorious and Horace Silver. Outside of the jazz world he has also done a lot of session work, appearing on hugely commercially successful albums like Donald Fagen&#39;s &quot;The Nightfly&quot;, &quot;Graceland&quot; by Paul Simon, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; by Dire Straits, and Chaka Khan&#39;s &quot;Chaka Khan&quot; (in addition to countless others). On this album Randy also provides vocals on the track &quot;Oh My Stars&quot; - I&#39;ve always found this track a little strange and it sticks out on the album. It feels as though this is a concession to a record company to try and write a radio friendly &quot;hit&quot; but for me it&#39;s a bit wide of the mark and it&#39;s a track I almost always skip. . The album also features a relatively fresh faced David Sanborn on alto. Sanborn has, rather unfairly, been associated with &quot;smooth jazz&quot; since some of his records have had commercial success and he has done some crossover R&amp;B type work. He has still recorded with many of the greats in more &quot;serious&quot; settings too and while his solo records are not ones I gravitate towards it&#39;s a little unfair to lump him in the &quot;smooth&quot; camp. His playing on this record alone shows he certainly has the chops and it is quite cool to hear him in this setting as it&#39;s not something you hear from him often. Overall this is really quite a fun &quot;jazz-funk&quot; fusion record. It is certainly &quot;of a time&quot; but you cannot deny the sheer musical ability of all involved. If you want to hear chops there are worse places to go, assuming you can live with the rather dated production values. Regardless it is worth a listen from a &quot;jazz history&quot; standpoint to hear one of the directions jazz-fusion was heading in the mid 1970s. For Michael Brecker fans this album also provides great insight into how his playing was developing at this time. .",

The technical specs of this coffee are that is a washed Colombian coffee consisting of Caturra and Castillo varietals - and as always I selected the &quot;filter roast&quot; option. It is grown at 1900masl by a community of farmers within the Yacuanquer area. This is in the south-west corner of the country, not too far from the border with Ecuador. This is not an area I see many coffees from so I&#39;m happy to give it a try - doubly so after the &quot;Spring Claude&quot; which is one of my favourite coffees of 2020. . I&#39;ll try and keep the blog tight this week so everybody can get back to their festivities - so lets dive straight into looking at the coffee itself. On the dry aroma I get a lot of dark and rich caramel notes first of all, combined with this there is the unmistakable blackcurrant note too, to be honest if I was given this blind I might have guessed it was a Kenyan. . Moving swiftly on to the filter coffee: here the major note is blackcurrant. It is a huge juicy coffee and it is a bit like drinking hot ribena - albeit less sweet. There is a good amount of acidity in the cup and it provides just the right amount of &quot;mouth drying&quot; in the finish. It is not the most complicated cup I&#39;ve ever had but it is certainly delicious and very drinkable, in fact it always seems to disappear faster than I expect. If you want an accompanyment to a mince pie/sausage roll/whatever your festive snack of choice is you could do much worse! . As an espresso I find that this coffee needs to be ground extremely fine, I ended up not too far away from the minimum my grinder would allow. Otherwise it is a coffee very prone to &quot;gushers&quot;. Thankfully once you reach a certain point it has a very large sweet spot though which makes it a breeze to dial in. I ended up with a very traditional 1:2 ratio in 30s with a medium heat. This results in a thick viscous juicy shot that bashes you round the head with blackcurrant. It is almost a bit like cough mixture (but in a good way). Certainly a tasty shot that is very easy to drink, the acidity is there but is not overpowering and there is a lot of sweetness. It&#39;s just a no-nonsense quality espresso. . Overall a rather successful &quot;christmas coffee&quot;, and I&#39;ll likely hunt down the 2021 Santa Claude next year. . For the jazz this week I feel like we need something special for the festive season. I&#39;ve resisted going down the &quot;christmas songs&quot; route because they tend to be &quot;good for christmas music&quot; rather than good in general. Instead we are going to welcome the inimitable Charles Mingus to the blog for the first time, with his 1957 (or 1962) album &quot;Tijuana Moods&quot;. . . Mingus is one of my all time favourite artists, for me his music transcends jazz and is something much bigger. I find that with Mingus it is not music you want to put on while doing other things, it commands your entire attention. There is so much going on technically and there is so much raw emotion it is just too intense to have as background music. As a result I don&#39;t listen to him as much as some other artists, but I do make sure to find time to do so. . Choosing an album from the Mingus back catalogue is tricky, there are so many good ones to choose from. The obvious place to start would be &quot;Mingus Ah Um&quot; - which is as near to perfect as it&#39;s possible for a jazz album to be. Or perhaps &quot;Black Saint and the Sinner Lady&quot; - for being art at the absolute highest level. However my favourite, and the one I find myself coming back to, is &quot;Tijuana Moods&quot;. For me it is the perfect balance between his compositional prowess and the free improvisation. At one time Mingus described this as his &quot;best album&quot; but it often gets a bit overshadowed by others (which is not a bad problem to have as an artist.) &quot;Tijuana Moods&quot; is a &quot;fusion&quot; album of sorts, managing to blend traditional Mexican music with American jazz and blues sensibilities. More than anything else it seems like the musicians are just having a blast recording this music - something you can&#39;t often say about Charles, he isn&#39;t known as &quot;the angry man of jazz&quot; for nothing! For those new to Mingus there are many famous stories of him chasing musicians off stage, ripping strings of grand pianos and even attacking band members. There is also of course the famous &quot;Mingus light&quot; at the Village Vanguard where he threw his bass into it (reportedly they never fixed it in tribute to the great man). . In jazz, and even society at large, we do have a problem of fetishizing the concept of the &quot;troubled artist&quot; or &quot;tortured genius&quot; - but for Charles Mingus this label certainly fits. If you are interested I highly recommend his autobiography &quot;Beneath the Underdog&quot; (although it is not a happy or easy-going read). He often described himself as a &quot;mongrel&quot; - since he felt too &quot;black&quot; to be accepted by the &quot;white community&quot; and too &quot;white&quot; to be accepted by the &quot;black community&quot;. It appears a lot of his anger came from this feeling, and understandably so. Of course his later career was also riddled with illness where he suffered from ALS (&quot;Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease&quot;) - we can only imagine how much more great music he could have released given the chance. . Originally the album was released with &quot;Charlie Mingus&quot; on the cover, a name Charles despised saying &quot;Charlie is not a man&#39;s name, it&#39;s the name of a horse&quot;. Later it was repackaged with alternate takes as &quot;New Tijuana Moods&quot; - but to be honest I&#39;m not a fan of these &quot;extended&quot; releases, I want to hear the music the artist was happy with an wanted to showcase not additional takes that weren&#39;t considered as good at the time. I feel like I&#39;m alone in this as every year we get re-releases of these great albums with newly discovered takes and I just don&#39;t see the appeal. So I&#39;d recommend you stick to the original &quot;Tijuana Moods&quot; release which comes in at a quick 40 minutes or so. You&#39;ll notice I&#39;ve not even tried to describe the music too much here. I feel whatever I do will not do the album justice and you&#39;re better off just listening for yourself. There is so much going on in some of the arrangements that you&#39;ll likely uncover something different to me anyway. You will find a wide range of musical styles on display however, from the mariachi band inspired sections, through to real swinging jazz and gospel blues. There will be dissonant parts followed by sweet melodies you will be humming for days afterwards. It is really a treat for the ears. It remains shocking to me how Mingus is not considered one of the greatest composers of all time, unfortunately I believe a lot of this is down to how African-American people are viewed in the states. . So if you&#39;re at a loss for music to listen to over the festive period and you&#39;ve never heard Charles Mingus (or &quot;Tijuana Moods&quot;) before it is well worth your time. If you do know the album; perhaps it&#39;s time to give it another listen? .",

            "title": "After Hours and Ana Sora",
            "content": "The coffee on the blog this week once again comes from firm favourite Plot coffee roasters - and unsurprisngly we have another coffee from an Israel Degfa owned farm. If you have read my previous posts you will recognise Israel Degfa and so we won&#39;t get into his business/charity again. This time we are looking a farm called Ana Sora from the Guji zone within the Oromia region. . This coffee picqued my interest because of the processing method: described as a &quot;Semi-Carbonic Natural&quot;. It is not a method I can remember seeing very often in the past, and given my love of Ethiopian coffee (and trust in Plot) I felt it was worth a try. The details of the processing are as follows: the cherries are left to macerate in tanks for 36 hours. The cherries at the bottom get crushed and release CO2 which forces oxygen out of the tank. The reduced oxygen means that bacteria are unable to operate as well (as they would in a &quot;regular&quot; natural process). After this process the cherries are dried as usual on raised beds. A very interesting process that should impact the cup. . Moving swiftly onto the coffee itself: the first thing I notice on the dry aroma is fruit, lots and lots of fruit! It is quite a sweet fruit smell as opposed to a tropical fruit. It almost has a candy quality to it, very inviting! . As usual we follow up with a filter coffee brewed in the usual way. As expected from the dry aroma the overwhelming quality of the cup is &quot;fruit&quot;. The label lists: lychee and apricot. Which I think is fair, it has that sticky sweetness I associate with the lychee and as a coffee from Guji it naturally has that apricot vibe. I also notice some more acidic fruit notes however, a citrus that I&#39;d suggest most closely resembles a lemon sharpness. But the first thing I wrote down when taking my first sip was: Strawberry. For me it&#39;s what this coffee is about, imagine some strawberries macerated in sugar before being added to a very crisp lemonade - that is the best description I can come up with for the cup. There is more to it than this however and it is certainly a complex cup - there are floral notes aplenty as the drink cools. It&#39;s a very drinkable cup but can also keep you entertained when searching for flavour descriptors. . As an espresso this coffee really shines for me. The roast level for this coffee is fairly light so unsurpisingly &quot;hot, fast, long&quot; is my advice. I put my machine to near top temperature and pulled 1:2.75 in 22s when I dialed it in - however it is fairly forgiving. I found going shorter made the shot a bit too intense, with all the complexity of this coffee it is a bit overwhelming. Again for me the first thing I thought of when tasting was strawberry. It has a sticky mouthfeel too so it sort of gives an impression of strawberry jam (without the pits). Again the apricot and lemon notes are there too but they take more of a backseat, the florals all but disappear when put up against the bigger stronger flavours. This is one that I couldn&#39;t get enough of as an espresso, I&#39;d be knocking back the shot in milliseconds then instantly wanted to go back and make another. A very good quality for a coffee to have! . For the jazz this week we are heading way back to the 1940s and Minton&#39;s Playhouse in Harlem with the Charlie Christian album &quot;After Hours&quot; featuring Dizzy Gillespie. . . This album represents a very significant time and place in Jazz history. Following the swing era many of the modern jazz musicians were looking at where the artform should go &quot;post-swing&quot;. The forward looking musicians of the day would play their regular swing based gigs during the evening and then hang out &quot;after hours&quot; without an audience to experiment and push things forward. Minton&#39;s Playhouse in Harlem was one of the key destinations for this, the owners not only allowed the musicians to play whatever they liked they also offered them food for doing so - an irresistable combination for jazz musicians at the time. Of course through this experimentation came the language of be-bop - the &quot;After Hours&quot; album acts as an insight into how the change from swing to bop came about. Much of the album swings but you can see the beginnings of the be-bop harmony coming into play. For any jazz fan interested in the history of the music this is a very interesting recording. . I have to give a quick warning however, since this was recorded in a jazz club (not a studio) around 80 years ago the sound quality is not the best you&#39;ll find. If you enjoy pristine recordings this is unlikely to be the record for you! I also note that this album appears under a number of names, I believe &quot;After Hours&quot; is the most famous of these - however I also mistakenly bought a copy of &quot;Dizzy Gillespie - Stardust&quot; on vinyl which ended up being the exact same recording! . The album is essentially split into a &quot;Charlie Christian&quot; section (5 tracks) and a &quot;Dizzy Gillespie&quot; section (4 tracks). Each section also features Kenny Clarke on drums and Thelonious Monk on piano with a few others appearing in either of the sections. Dizzy Gillespie needs no introduction, being one of the most famous jazz musicians of all time and has the nickname of &quot;the ambassador of jazz&quot;. While Charlie Parker gets a lot of the credit for popularizing be-bop Dizzy is one of the ones who &quot;worked out&quot; how to get the music to work on a theoretical level - in the early days some even referred to him as &quot;the professor&quot;. The Dizzy tracks on &quot;After Hours&quot; give just a hint of what is to come, you can see his mind working and the early ideas he had on be-bop. This makes the album essential listening and completely fascinating. . The Charlie Christian section, however, likely gets talked about the most. This is due to a lack of recordings on Charlie given his short career and tragic death at the age of just 25 - one can only imagine where he could have taken the music given a chance. He is best known for appearing in the Benny Goodman band - which to be honest while a lot of fun does not give musicians a chance to really stretch their legs and show off some chops. &quot;After Hours&quot; is perhaps the best example we have of what Charlie was &quot;really about&quot;. . It&#39;s worth remembering that Charlie Christian is really the &quot;first guitar hero&quot; in a lot of ways. He was somewhat fortunate that his rise to prominence coincided with the advent of the electric guitar - prior to this guitars were acoustic and as such it was not really possible to cut through a band with single note lines. Charlie was really the first to show the guitar could also be a lead instrument (at least the first in a commercially successful setting). You would normally expect the first electric guitar sounds to be terrible by today&#39;s standards - but for my money Charlie has the best electric guitar tone in all of jazz. Unlike those that followed him he used a relatively bright and clear tone and given the rather low-powered amp of the day (the Gibson EH150) he was typically at the edge of break-up. As technology &quot;improved&quot; jazz players opted for cleaner and cleaner tones and rolled off more and more top end from their sounds. In addition to the amp a key part of the sound is the guitar pickup he used, now referred to as the &quot;Charlie Christian&quot; pickup. These too are quite different from modern pickups, the originals feature large soft and relatively weak magnets compared to the harder more powerful alnico and ceramic ones of today. They also feature wire that is significantly thicker than the wire used in say a PAF or fender pickup (modern pickups tend to use around 42 gauge wire while the Charlie Christian styles use 38) - the thicker wire allows less top-end to be rolled off and so you can make a hotter pickup that retains clarity (which in turn pushed the weaker amps of the day harder). Of course a thicker wire takes up more space which is likely why they became less popular. I am a big fan of the Charlie Christian style pickups however and it is core to my guitar sound, I like to use http://www.ccpickups.co.uk/ here in the UK - no affiliation, just a fan. I remember when I first picked up a copy of &quot;After Hours&quot; clearly. I bought a copy on vinyl from a record shop in Reading. It is a rather haphazard shop that sells old comic books, action figures as well as old records and so on. The guy that runs the place is a big jazz fan and there are hundreds if not thousands of records in the shop. These are not in any sort of order so it takes ages to flick through to find anything, but in doing so you uncover gems (such as this one). When I went to pay the owner told me how this was &quot;one of his favourite albums&quot; and how he &quot;hates the Benny Goodman recordings- but Charlie is great on this&quot;. I enjoy shops like this where you get interesting interactions with the owners, something that is sadly disappearing with the increase in online shopping. Perhaps the most mystifying thing with this shop however is the pricing &quot;structure&quot; - the label prices on the records are insane but when you go to pay he does some bizarre mental arithmetic and you end up paying less than half the label price. It is super confusing and you never know quite what you&#39;ll end up paying - which adds to the excitement I guess. .",

            "title": "There is a Tide and Haraz",
            "content": "In this blog post we are in for a treat. Historically it has been very hard to get hold of quality Yemeni coffee, owing largely to the political climate in that region. When coffee did make its way out of Yemen it was often lacking in provenance and traceability. In recent times it has become easier to get hold of good quality coffee from Yemen. In September of this year there was also the QIMA auction for coffees from Yemen - including some lots consisting of the newly discovered &quot;Yemenia&quot; varietal. In this blog post we look at the first coffee in Plot Roasting&#39;s &quot;Icon&quot; series - a superb and rare Yemeni coffee. . Let&#39;s start with a recap of Plot Roasting: these guys (and girls) are relatively new to me having only discovered them earlier in the year but have continually impressed with their quality and attention to detail. They have become one of the regular roasters featuring on this blog and have yet to disappoint. Earlier in this month they launched their &quot;Icon&quot; series of coffees - once a month they will be releasing an extremely rare and special coffees with limited availability. Obviously &quot;rare&quot; means the price for this is a bit higher than their other offerings but I could not resist buying this one. The bag itself is only 150g in nature so for this blog I will focus only on filter, I don&#39;t believe that 150g is enough to dial in espresso and still have some filter coffee. If you&#39;re into espresso rest assured next week normal service will resume! . The coffee in question today is called Haraz and it is a micro community lot. The community is located in the region west of Sana&#39;a and the coffee is processed in a natural style. Yemen is an interesting origin to look at since it is in some sense &quot;the birthplace of coffee&quot; in as much as it was the first place where the crop was grown commercially. I have to admit I don&#39;t have a huge amount of experience with Yemeni coffees, I&#39;ve tried a few at various coffee shops/events over the years but I think this might be the first bag that I have bought for myself. While not the sort after &quot;Yemania&quot; this coffee consists of the Ja&#39;adi varietal - which as far as I know is only native to Yemen and it&#39;s not a varietal I&#39;ve seen elsewhere. . So let&#39;s dive straight into looking at the coffee itself. The dry aroma from this coffee is, frankly, bizarre. As I am grinding it I get a very strong &quot;meat&quot; note. It actually reminds me of something oddly specific: Royster&#39;s T-Bone crisps! It took me a while to pin-point exactly where I recognised the scent from but it very obvious now (I used to eat a lot of these crisps as a child). In addition to this I also get a strong clove note coming through. It is a very pungent and hard hitting coffee from a dry aroma perspective and certainly very distinctive. . Now onto the filter itself: this coffee is certainly different. It is difficult to describe in terms of comparisons to other coffees as it has its own thing going on. For me the bigggest flavour is cola. It reminds me of drinking cola at a cinema (or wherever you usually drink cola) - just at a higher temperature. In addition that clove note comes out again too and hits hard. I also get the Turkish delight note listed on the bag, but only after it was pointed out (perhaps because I&#39;ve only eaten Turkish delight a couple of times in my entire life). In the aftertaste and finish strong violet florals also come out to play, I find this coffee a bit of a rollercoaster in terms of flavour profile - it is super complex and changes dramatically through the life of the drink. If you like discovering flavour notes this is one for you - you&#39;ll undoubtedly find dozens of other notes I have not mentioned (I only mentioned the biggest ones here). In terms of mouthfeel and body we are definitely at the heavier end of the scale here, it almost has a &quot;chewy&quot; texture. . All in all a very strange and interesting coffee, for me it was well worth the price of admission and I would buy it again. However, I could see some people absolutely despising this coffee and being very upset they spent the premium on it. I would suggest this is a coffee for an &quot;advanced&quot; coffee drinker and not one for somebody just starting their specialty coffee journey - but everybody is different so if these flavour notes appeal to you and you are will to pay certainly give it a go. . Moving onto the jazz side of the blog we have something equally special to listen to this week: Chris Potter&#39;s &quot;There is a Tide&quot; . . This is an album jazz fans have been eagerly awaiting since it was announced around summer of this year. To see why this album has caused such a stir in the community one only has to look at the personnel: . Chris Potter - Saxophones | Chris Potter - piano, keyboards | Chris Potter - electric and acoustic guitars | Chris Potter - bass guitar | Chris Potter - clarinet, bass clarinet, flute, alto flute, | Chris Potter - drums, percussion | Chris Potter - samples | . That is correct, this is an entirely &quot;one man band&quot; album with Chris playing all instruments and recording at his home studio during lockdown. We (should) all know that Chris Potter is one of, if not the, best saxophonists in the world today having released albums under his own name as well as appearing alongside artists such as Pat Metheny, Dave Holland, Paul Motian, Dave Douglas and countless others. Many see him as carrying the torch from Michael Brecker in pushing the limits of the saxaphone to new heights. . A completely solo album is an interesting concept, I can&#39;t think of many examples where jazz musicians have experimented with this in the past - at least from a &quot;big&quot; name. Pat Metheny had his Orchestrion project of course but that was a different prospect as that was largely mechanically controlled (mostly from his guitar) as opposed to playing individual instruments. I guess Jacob Collier would be the other name that might spring to mind here - but past that you tend to find yourself in the region of more obscure artists. Jazz has always had a history of adapting to the times, given the current state of the world perhaps these solo &quot;mad scientist&quot; style projects will become more prominent. . What immediately strikes me with &quot;There is a Tide&quot; is just how &quot;pure&quot; the album feels. You can tell there is a single focus and creative direction, it seems very different to a typical small/big band project where you get a blend of ideas. I think this is highlighted because Potter does not have &quot;chops&quot; on say the guitar. In recent projects he had Adam Rogers playing guitar who is (clearly) very talented and so plays complicated lines and technically difficult solos. On &quot;There is a Tide&quot; in contrast the guitar (and piano, drums, etc) play the supporting role - this is not to say Potter is &quot;bad&quot; on these instruments (far from it) but you can tell he doesn&#39;t have the same fluency as on the sax. This makes the statments he is making on the woodwind instruments really standout and shine. It is a very different and unique sound, if you have heard any Chris Potter projects in the past &quot;There is a Tide&quot; is &quot;the same, just more&quot;. Since its release about a week ago this album has been on a near constant repeat at JazzCoffeeStuff HQ. Even still I struggle to think of a suitable way to describe the music on this album. The album starts with &quot;I Had a Dream&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog). Which I guess you could describe as being in the &quot;fusion&quot; style with the main theme slowly coming together around a driving (electric) bass line. As you would expect from Chris it doesn&#39;t take long for this to descend into some complicated rhythmic ideas and a searing tenor solo. . This is in contrast to a tune later on the album &quot;Drop Your Anchor Down&quot; (embedded above) which is largely based around a catchy hook, I&#39;ve found myself humming this one multiple times throughout the week. It is probably the least &quot;complicated&quot; of all pieces on the album so one that might get overlooked but is worthy of some love. . Most will listen to Chris Potter, however, to hear the complicated mind-bending rhythms and symmetric and diminished sax lines. This is most evident on &quot;Rising Over You&quot; (embedded below) which I imagine will be considered the &quot;stand-out&quot; track of the album by jazz fans. It has the Wayne Krantz style syncopations combined with the Michael Brecker influenced sax lines as one would expect in the main theme. Amongst the chaos it is important to bring the energy levels down in order to let the solos speak, which Potter does masterfully. I imagine in the coming weeks we will see many YouTube videos of people playing licks from this one. As one would expect from a &quot;lock down album&quot; the underlying themes revolve around the current state of the world. It does not take Columbo to work out the meaning with track titles such as: &quot;As the Moon Ascends&quot;, &quot;New Life (In the Wake of Devastation)&quot; and so on. Once again, as it has many times throughout history, jazz is showing it&#39;s resiliency in the face of struggle. . Really, whatever I write here will not do the album justice. It is well worth hunting down a copy if you have not already. Although it&#39;s only been a week I think it is safe to say this album will be in contention for &quot;album of the year&quot; in most 2020 year end reviews (and if not it: it should be!) .",

            "title": "80/81 and Balesi Dingu",
            "content": "This week on the blog we are sticking with the Round Hill coffee roastery for a second week in a row. I&#39;ve talked many times about Round Hill in the past so won&#39;t cover the same ground again - but if this is your first time reading the blog the concise version is: &quot;buy coffee from Round Hill&quot;. . It will come as no surprise that we are looking at another Ethiopian coffee. Ethiopia is my favourite origin and so I end up buying/drinking a lot of it. Usually I head towards the washed coffees but this one is a natural process instead. This coffee is a single farmer lot, this is something a little out of the ordinary within Ethiopian coffee. A lot of the time farmers will lack the distribution chain to be able to connect with importers/exporters/roasters and instead have to deal with a washing station. These deals are typically for a fixed price and their lot will be blended with other lots and so there will be a lack of tracebility. In this case the coffee takes its name from the farmer himself: Balesi Dingu. . Diving straight in to the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I do not get a whole lot to be honest. There are hints of citrus and a nudge of florals but overall it is quite tame. From this I gather that this will not be a very &quot;natural&quot; natural and we are in for a relatively clean cup profile. . As usual we start with a filter. With this coffee I found I had to adjust my grind size to the coarser side, which is quite interesting. Usually I don&#39;t recommend changing grind size for filter coffees as you end up losing a lot of time and effort for minimal gain. However in this case with my usual setting I was noticing a bit of harsh bitterness in the finish which I did not enjoy, by knocking the grinder 1 step coarser the whole coffee came alive. The major flavours are the peach and apricot notes one would expect, combined with a grapefruit type acidity and some florals on the back end. Earl Grey tea/bergamot would be a good way to describe the florals in my opinion. This is quite a clean cup but the natural processing method brings in some more body to the cup. I would describe it as a creamy body, it is not a super chew-y huge mouthfeel but it is noticable and adds to the cup enjoyment. . Moving onto the espresso. Again this is the &quot;filter roast&quot; option of this coffee and so all my usual advice applies. In the end I settled for 1:2.75 in about 22s at a high heat - basically what you would expect for a coffee of this style. Unfortunately this sacrifices some of the mouthfeel I noticed in the filter but in my opinion the extra sweetness opens the espresso up. It becomes a very sweet peach iced tea in espresso form, very drinkable. The grapefruit acidity is there but it is not overbearing, in fact I would say it is perhaps medium or even medium-low acidity. This could be one that would surprise those who think this roast style is &quot;too light&quot; for espresso. . Again another solid showing from Round Hill, for my money one of the most dependable roasters out there and for the money one of the best value. Hats off to the boys and girls from Bath once again. . On the jazz side this week we are going all Pat Metheny. This time we are looking at the 1980 release called: &quot;80/81&quot;. . . The eagle eyed among you will have noticed that the tune embedded at the start of this blog is not actually from 80/81 but a later release from the Pat Metheny Unity Group. This was not a mistake, 80/81 was released on ECM records who are particularly vigilant about removing any YouTube videos of their recordings. As such it is next to impossible to find things to embed for this blog, instead I have taken re-recordings or live versions of some of the tunes off the album. For the full effect get a copy of the album itself, it is well worth your time. . With that out of the way let&#39;s talk about Pat. Pat needs no introduction - he is one of the biggest jazz artists in the world today; his gigs always sell out, he has countless Grammy wins, gold records and has worked with just about anybody you could possibly think of. If you are looking for a jazz gig that would convert somebody onto jazz I can&#39;t think of many better gigs to go to, Pat always puts on a fantastic show! I have been lucky enough to see him live numerous times and have yet to be disappointed. . Why then did I pick 80/81? There were many albums I could have picked here, he has recorded some all time classics over the years. 80/81 is one that I continually find myself coming back to however. Pat&#39;s style is typically fairly polished and produced, his albums are typically highly composed and in recent years have become increasingly complicated. 80/81 in contrast feels more &quot;organic&quot;, it is just a few guys in a room playing tunes and having fun. Pat doesn&#39;t do his synth guitar wailing, there is no Lyle Mays beautifully rich harmonies, it is the closest thing to a &quot;straight ahead&quot; album from Pat. It is worth looking at the line-up on this album: . Pat Metheny - Guitar | Charlie Haden - Bass | Jack Dejohnette - Drums | Dewey Redman - Tenor Sax | Michael Brecker - Tenor Sax | . This is an absolutely all-star cast, every member here is a legend in their own right with countless records and acolades to their name. Reportedly Metheny wrote the tunes on this album with these members in mind, he had a clear vision of exactly how he wanted the band to sound together. What is remarkable about this is that none of the 4 other members had recorded together previously. I had to double check this regarding Charlie and Jack as I found it very hard to believe. In addition this is the first album where Metheny played with any reed players - deciding to double up with a Redman-Brecker duo on this record. They tend to split tenor duties on the record however, they only appear together on 3 of the 9 tracks. . The album kicks off with &quot;Two Folk Songs&quot; - perhaps the most well known of the albums tracks (the Unity Group version from 2016 embedded at the start of the post). This is perhaps one of the most iconic opening tracks of any jazz album period, it is a relatively simple melody that will stick in your head for days. However the Jack Dejohnette drum work, for me, really brings the track to life - he manages to find a groove yet still push the music forward at the same time, no mean feat. It also features some sublime tenor work from Brecker. In some sense this was a turning point in Brecker&#39;s career and marked a slight change in approach for him and really opened up his vocabulary to become one of the greatest tenors of all time. . Another highlight is the tune &quot;The Bat&quot; which is quintessential Metheny. A slow meandering ballad full of Metheny-isms albeit with a different tonal-pallete thanks to the use of the tenor sax. It is refreshing to hear Pat&#39;s music in this format, as much as I love the other 80s recordings from him, some of the synth work does sound a bit dated now. &quot;The Bat&quot; in contrast sounds timeless to me. When recording this album it became apparent that Metheny had written too much music. A decision was made to instead turn this into a double-album (thankfully). The band then decided to take on the Ornette Coleman piece &quot;Turnaround&quot; - Charlie Haden being a long term collaborator with Ornette. It feels as though this was largely done on the fly and there is a great moment at the end of the tune where you can hear Charlie say &quot;Woah boy! Jack Dejohnette man!&quot;. . Another highlight of the album (and perhaps the most famous track on the album after &quot;Two Folk Songs&quot;) is the ballad &quot;Every Day (I Thank You)&quot; - which Pat wrote with Michael Brecker in mind. Brecker is best known for his wild Coltrane inspired diminished style lines and crazy up-tempo numbers, however he is also an exceptional on ballads. On this track (a live version embedded above) we get to hear Brecker at his most expressive and heartfelt, certainly not something to be missed. . 80/81 is such a solid album you could pick any of the tunes to write about, each has a story, envokes a feeling and is all around just fun to listen to. I&#39;d highly recommend you find a copy and just listen to it start to finish. It will be time well spent and one you&#39;ll likely find yourself coming back to time and time again. .",

            "title": "Love Hurts and Duromina",
            "content": "This week on the blog we are heading back to our friends at Round Hill Roastery all the way in sunny Bath. Round Hill are an old favoruite of the blog and have featured many times in the past so need no real introduction. . This time we are featuring a washed Ethiopian coffee called Duromina. This is a coffee I am very familiar with and have tried many times from many different roasters over the years. Duromina is a co-operative based in the town of Agaro within the Jimma zone of the West Oromia region. It was set up in 2011 and has helped develop specialty coffee production within the area. Previously farmers were producing lower quality coffees for use in blends, but the co-operative structure has allowed quality to increase and the farmers to earn a better premium for their work. . Being a co-operative comprised of many smaller farmers there has not been much in the way of varietal tracing for this coffee and as such it is labelled as &quot;heirloom varietal&quot;. This was standard practice for Ethiopian coffees for many years but recently some work has been done to trace the varietal types of each coffee. Hopefully this practice will become more adopted in time and we will be able to talk about the specificities of a Kume against a Wolisho varietal. . Diving straight into the coffee itself: as usual from Round Hill I chose the &quot;filter roast&quot; version of this coffee. On the dry aroma I get a faint light caramel note combined with some peach-y and floral type notes as one would expect from a washed Ethiopian. Overall the aroma is stronger than one might expect for a coffee like this, they can often be shrinking violets (excuse the pun). There is some complexity here but it does not come across as a super complex coffee upon first sniff. . Moving into a filter brew. The first thing I notice is the quintessential &quot;washed Ethiopian&quot; character, it is just a very good example of what to expect from this type of coffee. The major notes are peach iced tea and lavendar and violet style florals. The peach iced tea gives a delicate juicy flavour and lots of sweetness. The florals come in the finish and aftertaste and dry the palette just enough to want you to come back for more. This one is very drinkable - I always notice that I have far less left in the cup than I&#39;d like. It is in fact quite a &quot;linear&quot; coffee in that, for me, the flavour profile doesn&#39;t change too much as the drink cools. This might be because recently I&#39;ve had a number of coffees where this was a defining feature however. In terms of mouthfeel and body there is not a whole lot to talk about, which is not a problem for me as these are not characters I hunt down. . In the espresso we have to work a little bit to get the most out of it. As we would expect: turn the temperature up very high and pull the shot long is a good starting point. I found ultimately a 1:2.75 ratio worked best for me and my set-up. The resulting espresso is very clean and has great clarity of flavour so I wanted to exemplify that by pulling longer. Going any shorter than this the flavour clarity suffered slightly and you don&#39;t gain any additional mouthfeel so it was not worth it for me. Even at a longer ratio the flavours were still punchy and strong: as in the filter peach iced tea and lavendar florals were the major tasting notes. The aftertaste is relatively shortlived but very clean. . Overall another very good showing from Round Hill, but I would expect nothing less. . For the jazz this week I&#39;ve decided to cover a 2019 Mack Avenue records release from guitarist Julian Lage: &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. . . For those that do not know Julian, he started off as a &quot;child prodigy&quot;: he was subject of a documentary film at 8 years old, played at the Grammy&#39;s aged 12 and was a jazz faculty member at Stanford at 15. I believe his first recorded work was with Gary Burton in 2004 (aged 16) and his first release under his own name in 2009. Unlike many child prodigies he did not make a name for himself for simply having crazy chops, basically from the beginning he had a very ature and sophisticated sense of melody and harmony. In jazz there is a relatively low conversion rate between the child prodigy to established artist, and I believe one of the main reasons is the focus on technique and chops - it is much harder to develop a good touch, phrasing and harmonic identity. Of course none of this comes from a vacuum and there are hints of other players within Julians playing, I would say that Bill Frisell is a major influence in Julian&#39;s style (at least his current style) given the ability to go from simple pure melodies through to the avant garde seemlessly. . The cover art of &quot;Love Hurts&quot; shows a line of used matches, it is believed that this is meant to represent the feeling of &quot;burn-out&quot; of having the weight of expectation on his shoulders from a young age. It seems that in recent times Julian has become more at ease with these expectations judging by his interviews. He has always been a soft spoken, fairly shy character but he seems to relax much more in interviews now which nice to see. . Another thing that sets Julian apart from other jazz guitarists out there is his tone. Jazz guitar is often synonymous with some pretty horrible guitar sounds (even for well established and respected artists). Julian does not follow the typical &quot;L5 into a Polytone with the tone rolled down&quot; cliche. Instead he adopts something closer to a rock/blues sound. He is perhaps best known for playing a telecaster (type guitar) into a cranked tweed champ or similar, although recently he has been playing a Gretsch duo-jet style guitars including a signature model made by Collings. His tone is on the edge of break-up so not totally clean and he can get a bit of grit when he digs in hard. This is not something you often here in jazz where pristine cleans are often sort after. Unlike Bill Frisell however, he rarely uses effect pedals or uses them very sparingly instead letting the guitar and amp sing together. It is a very unfussy setup but the simplicity adds to the music I feel. . The title track of the album is &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (a live version embedded at the start of the post), a take on a ballad originally recorded by the Everly Brothers. On his Spotify channel Julian has a playlist of the &quot;original&quot; versions of the tracks he covered on this album and instead lists the Roy Orbison version of this track as the inspiration (a version I admit I had never heard before this morning not being a Roy Orbison fan.) Which once is pointed out makes a lot of sense with the arrangement Julian opted for. As with the rest of the album the arragements are stripped back, simple yet elegant. He seems to take the underlying meaning of the song and amplify it, I feel this version gets closer to capturing the spirit of the lyrics written by Boudleaux Bryant than any of the other versions of this song I have heard. The album features a large number of covers, of the 10 tracks only 2 are penned by Lage. This includes &quot;Tomorrow is the Question&quot; (a live version embedded above) originally by Ornette Coleman on an album of the same name from 1959. As one would expect playing an Ornette Coleman tune allows Julian much more freedom to improvise and take risks than on a ballad like the title track. This results in some truly mind-bending and finger-knotting lines being played throughout. When Julian is playing freely like this it feels as though he is able to completely disengage and play whatever lines he wants. With other players, even when playing free, you can notice certain lines/patterns occurring that stick to some basic structure. What makes Julian&#39;s playing so special is he is completely unpredictable, he can throw out a line that would take you months to analyse but then very quickly resolve it and bring you back to earth and move on to the next idea. I&#39;ve not heard many guitarists (or musicians generally) who can do this so fluently. It is truly magnificent to behold. . Other &quot;jazz covers&quot; on the album include &quot;The Windup&quot; from Keith Jarrett&#39;s &quot;Belonging&quot; album, &quot;Encore (A)&quot; also from Keith Jarrett on &quot;Eyes to the Heart&quot; and &quot;Trudgin&quot; off &quot;Jimmy Giuffre 3&quot; - Julian clearly went on a bit of an ECM records binge while recording this album. In addition there is the standard &quot;I&#39;m Getting Sentimental Over You&quot; - on the Spotify covers playlist Julian selected the Thelonious Monk version as the inspiration, which to be honest I don&#39;t hear too much of in this rendition but I&#39;ll take Julian&#39;s word for it. . That leaves a few more &quot;pop&quot; covers on the album including &quot;In Heaven&quot; - a song recorded by Peter Ivers and David Lynch that featured on the &quot;Eraserhead&quot; film soundtrack. Lastly we have &quot;Crying&quot; a Roy Orbison number, Julian obviously being a much bigger fan of Orbison than I am. . The two tracks penned by Julian are titled &quot;In Circles&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot;. On an album full of mostly covers it is often difficult to write tunes that stand up to the well established ones. It is kind of a double edged sword for jazz artists: if they write simple melodies that stick in your head they&#39;re accused of playing it safe or &quot;selling out&quot; yet if they throw every substitution and harmonic device they know at a piece they can become fairly forgettable. On this album Julian manages to write 2 pieces that can hold their own. &quot;In Circles&quot; features some really inventive playing based around a drone in the intro and follows it up with some really interesting rhythmic play later in the piece. In contrast &quot;Lullaby&quot;, as the name suggests, is a much more simple affair yet Julian is still able to stretch his fingers and play some expressive lines. If you have not heard Julian before and are looking for something new to listen to that is interesting but not too challenging then you could do much worse than look at &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. Be sure to pick up a copy from whichever channel you get your music from. .",

            "title": "London Jazz Festival and Carmelita",
            "content": "This week on the blog we are looking at the last of the current batch of Drop Coffee. I think Drop are consistently once of the best roasters going, unfortunately shipping costs mean I purchase from them less often than I&#39;d like. This goes for most other non-UK based roasters in fact. . The coffee in question today is from Bolivia, an origin we have spoken about a few times in the past. The farm is located in the Caranavi region, perhaps the most famous of all Bolivian coffee regions. The coffee goes by the name &quot;Carmelita&quot; which comes from the producer: Carmelita Urduvi. It has a washed fermented processing, a fairly standard approach from Drop&#39;s literature. . What is &quot;interesting&quot; about this coffee is the varietal it is a Java. This has nothing to do with the island of Indonesia - which I believe is the origin of the colloquialism &quot;a cup of java&quot;. Instead the Java varietal has a bit of a checkered history, originally thought to be part of the typica lineage it was later discovered to have its origins in Ethiopia (through a local landrace called Abysinia). Java is known for having very high cup quality and reasonable resistance against leaf rust and various other diseases. This makes it a good proposition for a &quot;Gesha-alternative&quot; that is easier for producers to grow while still leading to cup quality. . Let&#39;s move onto the coffee itself: as usual starting with the dry aroma I&#39;m getting 2 main notes: butter and pears. It is soft and fairly delicate in nature, and certainly very comforting. I&#39;m not getting much in the way of floral notes, which is a little surprising for a java (but perhaps less so for a Bolivian). The roast level appears to be towards the medium-light level - about the same as last weeks Hunkute but a touch darker than some of the previous Drops. . Moving onto our prototypical filter recipe: the first thing I notice is that there is quite a lot of body in this coffee. It is quite dense and heavy hitting. This is not something I typically look for but when it&#39;s there I won&#39;t complain. In terms of flavours again the butter and pears come to the forefront. The label says &quot;pear cider&quot; but I don&#39;t get the same sort of acidity I&#39;d associate with a cider. For me a more apt description would be a poached pear dessert with custard. As the cup cools down the finish and aftertaste becomes more intense and very sweet and floral in nature. I&#39;d describe it as a &quot;sticky floral&quot; like an elderflower or honeyblossom if pushed. . As an espresso I was extremely lucky to land on a perfect recipe first time! This is not something that happens very often, especially when jumping from a vastly different origin/varietal. How did I do this? I knew this bean would be less dense than the previous Hunkute so I would need to fine up my grind quite a bit. Given the qualities in the filter I knew the mouthfeel was something that would benefit from a shorter/standard pull compared to my usual approach - again pointing towards a finer grind. On the temperature side I knew a medium-high heat would work best given the roast levels we&#39;re dealing with. I ended with a 1:1.9 ratio with a 10s preinfuse followed by a 28s pull - pretty much a standard espresso recipe you&#39;d find anywhere on the web. As expected this leads to a big heavy buttery mouthfeel with sticky-pear sweetness and surprisingly the floral notes shine through. Despite being a heavy hitter it still has exceptional clarity. . To be honest this was a coffee I bought to &quot;make up the numbers&quot; to get free shipping on my order. I expected it to be one of the weaker offerings in my order but I have really enjoyed drinking it. It goes to show that you can&#39;t judge a coffee based on &quot;specs&quot; alone. . On the jazz side this week we are going to take a different approach. This past week has been London Jazz Festival, so in the evenings I have been listening to various livestreams/concerts so I thought I&#39;d give an round up of what I experienced. . . Unsurprisingly London Jazz Festival has been a bit different this year. Given the timing they were unable to allow &quot;in-person&quot; audiences and so everything has been live-streamed online. Of course you will never be able to capture the magic of live jazz through a screen in quite the same way, but I have to say being able to relax in my own home was quite nice. As much as I love Ronnie Scott&#39;s I did not miss being squeezed into the church pews and my legs going to sleep halfway through the first set! I also did not miss having to commute back home after the gigs finished, especially during mid-week! One evening isn&#39;t too bad but when the festival is on and you&#39;re doing something everyday and not getting home until past midnight most days the end of the work week can feel like hell on earth. . . The first artist I &quot;saw&quot; was Bill Laurence at Ronnie Scott&#39;s with a solo piano performance. Bill is best known for his work with the Snarky Puppy collective. I have to admit I struggle with Snarky a bit, don&#39;t get me wrong they&#39;re objectively a great band and put on fantastic live shows - the music just doesn&#39;t move me and I don&#39;t go reaching for their records. As such I&#39;m not really familiar with Laurence&#39;s solo work. The set opened with (I believe) a take on &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; and made me sit up and take notice. I was expecting more of a fusion oriented experience but Bill showed he has a wide jazz repertoire and played some beautifully emotive lines throughout. Much of the rest of the set was made up of his own music from his dystopian record &quot;Cables&quot; which was more in the fusion space. However he also presented a great rendition of the standard &quot;You Don&#39;t Know What Love Is&quot; - which was another highlight for me. He definitely did enough for me to take notice of his releases and gigs in future. . . The next gig on the agenda for me was Laura Jurd&#39;s Dinosaur at King&#39;s Place. As expected there were a few technical issues leading to a rather lengthy delay in start time - but when has a jazz gig ever started on time? I guess this adds to the realism. And a shoutout to the person in the chat who commented: &quot;Even Keith Jarrett didn&#39;t make me wait this long!&quot; - I genuinely laughed out loud at that. The gig was a play through of the latest 2020 release &quot;To the Earth&quot;. I swotted up before the gig to get familiar with this album so I could understand the tunes a bit better. The thing that really struck me was how different the feel was in this performance - each tune was played with a much looser, bluesy quality. On the record everything is much more clinical and precise, I have to say I much preferred the live version for feeling more organic. I guess they recorded the album using a click-track to get everything perfect. . The standout piece of the night for me was &quot;Slow Loris&quot; which really expemplified the blues groove the band had. And also a shoutout to pianist Elliot Gavin who was truly fantastic from start to finish. . It was kind of eerie hearing a jazz gig with no applause however, in the Ronnie Scott&#39;s gig above the crew/staff provided the applause which made the experience feel more &quot;real&quot;. Laura did here best to compere between tunes but there was only so much she could do. Perhaps they could have used a canned applause or similar to give the performance more atmosphere. . . Perhaps my highlight of the week was Linda Oh&#39;s performance. This one was not so much a &quot;performance&quot; as a sequence of recorded tracks. After each tune it cut so it was not clear whether this was recorded in one continuous set or, as is my assumption, tunes were recorded individually with breaks along the way. Regardless it was a truly incredible performance. . You could certainly tell the influence working with Metheny has had on Linda, there were plenty of &quot;Metheny-isms&quot; throughout the set (no bad thing). The music gently oscillated between bop, fusion and free styles with lots of mind-bending rhythmic patterns. At times there were even Zappa-style quintuplet lines thrown in for good measure. Linda split her time between acoustic and electric basses, with my favourite pieces being where she focussed on the former. But also a shout out to tenor saxophonist Jamie Oehlers for playing some dizzingly impressive lines throughout. . The music here was so adventurous, energetic and fast moving it is hard to do it justice with words. I have seen Linda live a few times both as a band member and a lead act, she is always worth watching. . . The last act I want to talk about is Harold Lopez Nussa. I&#39;ve been a fan of his since he first broke onto the scene play his Cuban jazz music. Traditionally it has been fairly hard for those outside of Cuba to hear the best Cuban artists but Harold has had some commercial success starting with his &quot;New Day&quot; album back in 2013 through his latest 2020 release &quot;Te Lo Dije&quot;. Much of this gig (streamed from Havana) featured music from this release. Here he moves a bit further from &quot;just&quot; playing Cuban jazz and takes influence from fusion, classical and popular music - it for example features a rendition of &quot;The Windmills Of Your Mind&quot; from the Thomas Crowne Affair fame. He also referenced his back catalogue and played &quot;Paseo&quot; one of my favourite pieces off his debut album. Overall, although atypical, a rather enjoyable London Jazz Festival. But here&#39;s to hoping that normal service can resume in 2021. .",

            "title": "Midnight Special and Hunkute",
            "content": "Hello and welcome to the 30th JazzCoffeeStuff blog post! In this installment, as last week we are sticking with Stockholm based Drop Coffee Roasters. This week we are featuring another washed Ethiopian coffee - probably my favourite &quot;style&quot; of coffee, so I have high hopes. . The coffee in question is called Hunkute - a name that may be familiar to those in the speciailty scene since many roasters offer/have offered this coffee in the past. As such I have a certain level of expectation going in to this coffee, unlike some of the previous offerings which have been totally new to me. . Hunkute is the name of the co-operative that processes the coffee. A co-operative, as the name suggests, is where many small local farmers (who would struggle to sell their coffee individually due to low yields) pool together their crops in order to sell their wares. This is quite common in some origins where farmers literally have trees in their back gardens as opposed to operating a large commercial farm. The Hunkute co-operative is made up of over 2000 members, the payment for the coffee gets split between the farmers (~70%) and investment in the washing station and admin costs (~30%). . Moving swiftly on; let&#39;s go straight into the coffee itself. On the dry aroma you get the typical profile one would expect from a washed Ethiopian such as this. Notes of citrus fruits, white florals and tea are present but it is a subtle affair. In the past I seem to remember this coffee being delicate and soft in nature, being a prototypical washed Ethiopian. In terms of roast level this is probably the &quot;darkest&quot; of the Drop offerings I&#39;ve had so far. That is not to say this is a dark or even medium roast, but compared to some of the very light roasts in the past few weeks it is a step towards medium-light. . As usual the next step is to make a filter brew in the usual way. Again this on does not give off a huge aroma during/after brewing, it is a very understated experience. In the cup however there are certainly flavour notes galore, the first I noticed was the citrus fruits again. I would describe it as a lemon-type citrus note, clean and refreshing. Perhaps edging into a juicy orange but for me this coffee is more of a clean one than a juicy one. Of course you get the peach iced tea notes that really characterise these sorts of coffees for me. Then we have the florals, part of the reason you hunt down a washed Ethiopian is for the florals and this surely does not disappoint. I would describe them as white florals - jasmine and honeysuckle come to mind - as opposed to say a violet note. The florals really come out to play as the coffee cools down and are particularly present in the finish and aftertaste. In terms of mouthfeel and body there is not much to talk about, it is not a &quot;big&quot; coffee - subtlty, softness and delicacy are how I would describe it. . Onto the espresso - these delicate coffees can sometimes be a bit of a pain for espresso, they can feel a bit empty. You sometimes have that you want to pull short to give some body and intensity but this leaves things a bit too harsh, but pulling longer to reduce the harshness leaves things water-y. Thankfully this coffee is not like this at all, I found it surprisingly easy to dial in, the &quot;sweetspot&quot; was massive and you could pull it how you want. In the end I went with a fairly typical 1:2.25 ratio, 5s pre-infuse follwed by a 24s pull. Temperature wise I was at the high end. This seemed to work best for me as it gave me a bit of extra texture to the shot which was lost at longer pulls. Going any shorter began to add some harshness in the aftertaste. The flavour profile of the shot very much matched that of the filter coffee, lemons and iced-tea were the main notes with just a hint of florals in the background. . Overall another great showing from Drop. This might not be a &quot;blow you away&quot; coffee in terms of having a really obscure flavour profile, but it is a solid example of what you would want from a washed Ethiopian. . Sticking with the theme of &quot;does what it says on the tin&quot; - the jazz this week is a 1961 release on Blue Note Records: &quot;Midnight Special&quot; by Jimmy Smith. . . This week has been a busy one in JazzCoffeeStuff HQ, as such I haven&#39;t wanted music to &quot;think&quot; about - instead I&#39;ve just needed something reliable to act as a soundtrack. Jimmy Smith is one of the artists I naturally head to in such situations. I know organs and &quot;soul jazz&quot; can be a bit of a contentious subject for some jazz fans. I&#39;ve seen a lot of vitriol aimed at the style, but for me it has its time and place. . To those unfamiliar with Jimmy Smith: he is a jazz heavy-weight. He played the Hammond b3 organ and essentially singlehandedly popularized its use within jazz. Others had used organs in the past (e.g. Fats Waller) but prior to Jimmy there wasn&#39;t anybody synonymous with the instrument. Without Jimmy it is unlikely we would have artists such as Joey DeFrancesco, John Medeski or Larry Goldings today, and most likely would not have great rock organists such as Jon Lord or Keith Emerson. Not only was his tone so distinctive on the instrument he had virtuosic chops to back it up, while some &quot;soul jazz&quot; dropped a lot of technique and harmonic complexity in favour of hard groove - Smith maintained a balance of blues grooves along with be-bop inspired lead lines and raw technique. As a lead artist he has over 80 records to his name plus a dozen or so as a sideman and achieved some commercial success - as such if you ask somebody to name a &quot;jazz organist&quot; Jimmy Smith is likely to be the first name they mention. . The album we&#39;re looking at today is &quot;Midnight Special&quot; which was recorded on a session in 1960 but not released until a year later. During the same session they also recorded &quot;Back at the Chicken Shack&quot; released in 1963. Both albums being fantastic and worth hunting down. Part of what makes the Blue Note records from this era so special is the sound quality from Rudy Van Gelder&#39;s studio and this is particularly true of &quot;Midnight Special&quot;, if you consider yourself a bit of an audiophile this is one for you! I also love the album cover of this one, it is a bit atypical of a Reid Miles cover: featuring a large colour photograph. But it is so well done, it really shouldn&#39;t matter but a good album cover really adds to the whole experience. Especially if you have a nice vinyl copy of the record. . The line up features: . Jimmy Smith – organ | Stanley Turrentine – tenor saxophone | Kenny Burrell – guitar | Donald Bailey – drums | . The full line up features on 3 of the 5 tracks on the album, Kenny sitting out of tracks 2 and 4 leaving a leaner trio format. . The album kicks off with the title track (embedded at the start of this post). Like many cuts on the album, and much of Smith&#39;s back catalogue, it is based on a blues. The longest track on the album at over 9 minutes and features some extended soloing. Jimmy in particular is able to stretch his legs and show off some chops. However Turrentine steals the show for me, with a very tasteful and restrained solo early on and then a second more emotive blues wail towards the end. Kenny&#39;s playing is also sublime on this take. Another highlight is track 3 &quot;Jumpin&#39; the Blues&quot;, another track featuring the entire quartet. This one is one of the more energetic pieces on show and gives everybody a chance to show off their chops. It probably features the most ambitious soloing on the album. Without a bass player Smith needs to drive the piece forward in the low end, this is paired with Bailey&#39;s swinging style. Although a &quot;blues&quot; it features a lot of the hallmarks of jazz and be-bop. This become evident in the solos where each player in turn uses the be-bop vocabulary masterfully. It is perhaps some of the best recorded soloing by Burrell in my opinion. Turrentine again plays his socks off too. . In addition to the blues the record also features a few slower down-tempo ballads too. The Smith-Turrentine interplay is on full display in these and it is really a joy to listen to. . On the whole the record is a masterpiece from start to finish. It allows the listener to engage at whatever level they feel comfortable. It is simple enough that it doesn&#39;t require your full attention, however the more you dig into it the more you can get out of it. If you have never listented to a Jimmy Smith record in the past this is a good a place as any to start! .",

            "content": "This week we feature another coffee from Drop coffee roasters in Stockholm. In order to make the shipping economical I had to order a few different coffees so they will appear for a few more blog posts yet! As I said previously they are one of my favourite roasters so this is no bad thing. . The coffee this week is another &quot;premium&quot; one - we have another washed Gesha varietal, this time from Bolivia. Bolivian Gesha is a relatively new phenomena for me, if you recall earlier in the year I had my first experience of this from Gold Box coffee. Bolivian coffee is an interesting one for me, it is one of the first origins I got into when I was first starting out with specialty coffees. Back then HasBean had a number of great Bolivian offerings. Unfortunately the political landscape in Bolivia has made it a little difficult to get quality coffee from the region, but this appears to be slowly changing and this year I&#39;ve noticed more and more Bolivians on offer. . This particular coffee comes from producers Pedro-Pablo, Daniela and Pedro Rodriguez with their Alasitas farm. Gesha is not a &quot;natural&quot; varital in Bolivia and so the Rodriguez family used seeds from the famed La Hacienda farm in Panama (the farm famed for popularising the Gesha varietal). The farm is located in famed coffee growing region Caranavi. . Moving on to the coffee itself. On the dry aroma I am getting mostly floral notes underlined with a caramel. It is not the most boisterous I&#39;ve ever come across but neither is it a shrinking violet (ignore the pun). An inviting and intriguing coffee for sure. . As usual we start by making a filter coffee, in much the usual way - you&#39;ll likely be bored of hearing about the technique/equipment by now. Taking the first sip my first thought was &quot;wow&quot; - this is truly an exquisite coffee. As you would expect from a Gesha it is subtle yet fragrant with a lot of complexity. The overarching flavour for me is peach iced tea, it has the juicy peachy quality, the sweetness but also the floral tea-like quality. As the cup cools there are waves after waves of floral notes: honeysuckle, lavendar, jasmine... basically think of any floral note and it will be there. It is really sensitive to temperature of the cup and it is constantly evolving. If you enjoy cup complexity and trying to work out flavour notes this is certainly one for you. The acidity is reasonable but not overbearing, the cup is definitely on the sweeter end. The mouthfeel and body are what I&#39;d describe as &quot;juicy&quot;. . Moving on to the espresso. To dial this one in I found that a med-high sort of temperature works best, for a ratio around 1:2.25 was the sweetspot - perhaps a little shorter than you would expect for a light roast filter coffee. For reference I was pulling this shot with a 5s pre-infuse followed by a 24s pull - a fairly &quot;standard&quot; espresso recipe despite being a filter roast. As an espresso everything great about the filter is just amplified. The mouthfeel gets juicier, the peaches get peachier and the florals really linger on the finish. As much as I loved it as a filter it is even better as an espresso! . This coffee is one I just couldn&#39;t get enough of, I was sad to see the bag come to an end. On the price scale it is certainly not cheap, but not quite at the price of the previous Gesha featured (and to be honest I prefer this one to that one - but both were fantastic). For my bank balance&#39;s sake I&#39;ll probably take a break from the Geshas for a while! . For the jazz this week I have picked another 2020 release. This one was released a few months ago (July) but I totally missed but it has been the soundtrack of my week since discovering it. The artist is Gerald Clayton and the album is called: &quot;Happening: Live at The Village Vanguard&quot;. His debut on the legendary Blue Note label. . . I guess the question is: why did this album pass me by for so long? I have to be honest here; Clayton is not somebody I follow religiously. He is (clearly) a great player but I just tend not to connect with his music as much as I do with other players. I have never seen him live under his own name however, perhaps if I saw him live that would have changed (hopefully I will get a chance soon). This album has changed my opinion somewhat and I&#39;ll be certain to follow a bit more closely in the future. . If you release an album called &quot;Live at The Village Vanguard&quot; you very quickly put a target on your back. Rightly or wrongly peopl will always compare your release to previous albums recorded there (for example Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane and so on). The Village Vanguard is the oldest continuously operated jazz club in the world (next on the list being London&#39;s own Ronnie Scott&#39;s). I have never had the opportunity to visit the Vanguard yet but it is somewhere I certainly plan to go to. Visually it is a fairly unassuming place, the room itself being essentially &quot;pizza slice&quot; shaped. But as with many of these old jazz clubs it has near perfect acoustics which makes it such a great venue and consequently why so many live albums have been recorded there. . Clayton can still be considered somewhat of a jazz &quot;up and comer&quot; at 36 years old, but given his &quot;child prodigy&quot; type background it does feel as though he has been around for a long time. In that time he has released 5 albums under his own name (including &quot;Happening&quot;.) And has also recorded and toured with artists such as Charles Lloyd, John Scofield, Roy Hargrove, Ambrose Akinmusire and Peter Bernstein among others. Certainly a well qualified CV for any modern jazz player. . The band takes the form of a quintet with the personnel on this album being: . Gerald Clayton - piano | Logan Richardson - alto saxophone | Walter Smith III - tenor saxophone | Joe Sanders - bass | Marcus Gilmore - drums | . This is not a &quot;star studded&quot; line up full of veterans with loads of acolades - instead a band of relative youngsters trying to make an impact. This gives the album itself a lot of vibrancy and energy, it feels fresh without falling into the trap of being &quot;too modern&quot;. This album has a unique sound but at the same time it feels as though it could have been released any time from the 1950s through to today. This is something that is not easy to achieve. The music itself is definitely in the &quot;post-bop&quot; universe with lots of twisting and turning rhythmic and harmonic devices used throughout. However in places it also borrows from the modal school and uses some &quot;fusion&quot; ideas (although there are no electric instruments on show here). When not flying at full speed there are also times when things are slowed down and you have time to catch your breath - here the influence of Bill Evans (another artist with a legendary Vanguard album) comes to the fore front. There are also nods towards latin and even hip-hop at times - like much modern jazz it is all about taking a wide variety of influences and trying to mash them together into something coherent. . The album spans 75 minutes while featuring just 7 tunes - so the band has a chance to really explore each one. 4 of the tunes are Clayton originals and 3 are standards including Ellington&#39;s &quot;Take the Coltrane&quot;, &quot;Body and Soul&quot; and Bud Powell&#39;s &quot;Celia&quot; - the latter 2 being presented in trio format (offering the sax players a well needed break!) . My &quot;highlight&quot; picks from the album are &quot;Rejuvenation Agenda&quot; (embedded at the start of this post), one of the Clayton originals. The main theme features some inter-twined sax lines and some really grooving drum work from Marcus Gilmore. The majority of the tune is made up of an extended piano solo from Clayton however. Here he shows off some great virtuosity but always respecting the tune, many of the new breed of jazz musician often forget this and just throw their chops at it. Another highlight is Ellington&#39;s &quot;Take the Coltrane&quot; (embedded above) which closes the album. It starts off with some Monk-like solo piano work before breaking into the tune proper. On this tune everybody gets a chance to take an extended solo and really stretch their legs. Each player seems to egg on the next to reach even higher heights. It essentially becomes a clinic on modern jazz improvisation. Again Gilmore&#39;s drumming is on point (and includes an awe inspiring solo) - some of the sax work really takes things to the next level. I guess this is fitting for a tune with &quot;Coltrane&quot; in the title. . If you were looking for a representation of the current state of live jazz you could do much worse than pick up a copy of &quot;Happening&quot;. It is one that I have been enjoying throughout the week - I&#39;ll certainly keep more of an eye out for Gerald Clayton releases in the future. .",

            "title": "Valentine and Adola",
            "content": "This week we are sticking with Drop coffee from Stockholm, who were featured last week on the blog. This time we are looking at a more &quot;reasonably priced&quot; coffee instead of a super expensive rare coffee. As is a trend on this blog it is a naturally processed coffee from Ethiopia. Again we are looking at the Guji zone within the Oromoia region - and yet again it is from a washing station owned by Israel Degfa&#39;s company. This blog might be becoming a bit predictable! The coffee takes its name from the washing station &quot;Adola&quot;. In addition to running the washing station Israel has also built a school in the local area so that the children can get an education, Drop offer an &quot;extra&quot; version of this coffee which includes a donation directly to the school. To be honest the &quot;extra&quot; cost to a bag of coffee is negligible (about £2.50 at time of writing) in the scheme of things so it is worth opting for this version in my opinion. . Unlike last week this coffee is one I could use as an espresso! In fact it was (mostly) what I was drinking as an espresso last week while using the Gesha as a filter. Usually I like to keep the same coffee on both filter and espresso as I like to see how the different characteristics come into play with each preparation method. For me it&#39;s rare I&#39;ll find a coffee that I love prepared one way but hate prepared another. I might prefer one to the other for a specific coffee but there&#39;s rarely a coffee that is only suited to one style. And as I have said multiple times on this blog I only ever opt for filter roasts or occassionally omni-roasts as I find these show off the coffees character most clearly. . Onto the coffee itself. The first thing to notice is this is very light roast, one of the lightest I&#39;ve had in a while. Grinding for filter on my handgrinder I could physically feel the difference in density compared to previous coffees. The dry aroma coming off the coffee is fairly subdued, there is a little natural processing funkiness and a bit of a floral note but that is about it. This is not a blow your socks off coffee on the nose. . Moving on to the filter prepared in the usual way. the first thing that jumped out to me is the funk. If you&#39;re unsure of what I mean by &quot;funk&quot; - some natural coffees that have been left in their cherries for a long time essentially start to ferment and develop a flavour profile sometimes referred to as funk. Funk is almost like a &quot;gone off&quot; taste (but in a good way). For me I always associate the funky notes with 2 things: firstly bruised fruits (typically blueberry) and alcohol (particularly fortified alcohol). Adola is not super funky, but it is noticable - espescially if you&#39;re like me and don&#39;t tend to drink the funky stuff very often. With the funk I also get huge sweetness in the cup combined with the mouthfeel it gives a sticky syrupy kind of quality. In terms of flavour notes blueberry is the first thing that comes to mind. As the cup cools it totally transforms however and the tropical fruits come out to play - it actually reminds me of those old fashioned pineapple cube sweets. All the way through there is a background floral note that adds a lot of elegance to the cup. With this coffee you&#39;re also given a really long aftertaste which is great when the coffee tastes so good. . you would naturally expect this coffee to be an absolute pig to dial in for espresso given how light the roast is but I actually found it surprisingly forgiving. As you would expect you want to whack up the temperature on your espresso machine to as high as it can reliably go and you want to pull longer shots. For a ratio something like 1:2.75 is a good place to start, I was pulling this one with a quick 3s or so pre-infuse then a 25s pull - so not super quick compared to some. As an espresso this coffee is truly fantastic. The sweet sticky syrupy quality from the filter just gets amplified and it&#39;s one of the sweetest cups you&#39;ll find. The funkiness is there but is not overbearing, combined with the florals it gives the cup elegance and keeps it interesting. The pineapple cube note is unfortunately nowhere to be found in the espresso but the long aftertaste is thankfully still there. This is a coffee I&#39;d give to somebody unsure about lighter roast coffees for espresso, it is a slightly different experience to a more developed roast but I&#39;d struggle to see how anybody could not find this delicious. . Overall this is another fantastic coffee from Drop. I said it in my last post but I&#39;ll repeat it here: for my money Drop is in the truly &quot;elite&quot; level of coffee roasters. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a bad coffee from them, I just wish they were a bit easier to get hold of in the UK! . For the jazz this week we&#39;re going to look at another relatively recent release (from August 2020). From the Blue Note record label it is Bill Frisell&#39;s latest: &quot;Valentine&quot;. . . Bill has appeared a couple of times on this blog but never with an album under his own name. I heard this album the day it was released and have been listening to it since. I am unapologetically a huge Frisell fan-boy so I have been a bit reluctant to feature this album on the blog - I wanted to make sure my fan-boy-ism wasn&#39;t causing me to overhype it. But after a few more listens I have come to the conclusion that it is actually that good and is up there with Bill&#39;s best. . On Valentine Bill is joined by regular collaborators: Rudy Royston on the drums and Thomas Morgan on the bass. Although Bill has recorded with countless musicians in the past for his own projects he seems to have a small &quot;inner-circle&quot; with whom he collaborates regularly. I think this is an important part of the magic of some of his recordings/performances since it is very much focussed on interaction and intimacy between band members. In his post-ECM recordings he tends to take relatively simple tunes and elevate them to new levels. Often re-recording the same few tunes in different ways on his various projects. This is in some sense similar to Thelonious Monk who also had a relatively small repertoire but continually re-invented them (unlike say a Duke Ellington who wrote many pieces). Bill is in some sense similar to Monk in other ways too; he often focusses on rhythmic ideas and creating space when playing, and of course he has a history of playing Monk tunes with the Paul Motian band(s) earlier in his career. On this album the title track &quot;Valentine&quot; is quite clearly “an affectionate wink to Thelonious Monk&quot; (to use Bill&#39;s own terms) with its twisting time signatures, angular melody and humorous motifs. . The track list will be familiar to the more seasoned Frisell fan. It features &quot;Winter Always Turns to Spring&quot; featured on &quot;Ghost Town&quot; and &quot;Levees&quot; from the Great Flood documentary. Along with familiar pieces such as &quot;What the World Needs Now&quot; and &quot;Baba Drame&quot; (off &quot;The Intercontinentals&quot;) which he has done renditions of in the past. This habit of re-visiting pieces is very interesting as it allows us to see how Bill has matured and evolved over the years and it invites comparison. Often he will entirely re-work the piece for a new format so it never just feels like re-treading old ground. . The album closes with the civil rights anthem &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; (another tune that Bill has played many times in the past). This is embedded at the start of this blog, along with a great piece of animation in the music video (I would suggest watching it in its entirety at some point). In this version he sticks very closely to the melody and remaining faithful to the tune itself. Given the civil rights issues in the recent past it feels as though this was intentional. The latter part of the album features many tracks that seem aimed at the current world landscape: &quot;Winter Always Turns to Spring&quot;, &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, &quot;Where Do We Go?&quot; and a beautiful rendition of Bacharach&#39;s &quot;What The World Needs Now&quot; (embedded above is a live version from a recent socially distanced outdoor gig). The track titles combined with the dream like quality to the arrangement appears to be Bill&#39;s attempt at fostering hope going forward. He is not an artist you&#39;d associate with making political statements typically but I guess that is what he is trying to do with &quot;Valentine&quot;. Perhaps his recent work with Charles Lloyd, who is relatively outspoken, has rubbed off on him? . Any writing I do about the music on this album will not do it justice, if you have heard any recording of Bill&#39;s from the past 20 years or so you&#39;ll know what to expect. This is not a particularly &quot;groundbreaking&quot; album but more of a solidification of the style built up over the past years. It is one of the most complete and polished offerings in the Frisell cannon so is well worthy of your time. The interplay between Frisell/Thomas/Royston is something to behold, it can easily go over your head the first few times you hear them but once you really start to pay attention you can see how well they work as a unit. There is no &quot;flashiness&quot; here just good solid performances all round. As it&#39;s incredibly rainy in London right now, I&#39;d definitely recommend the album for some rainy afternoon listening. . I&#39;ll end with a funny story I have about Bill: a few years ago I saw him live when he was touring the &quot;Guitar in the Space Age&quot; album where he was revisiting tunes from his childhood. It is probably the most &quot;pop&quot; or radio friendly album he has released. I was in the front row and sat next to a party of Americans visiting London. Those who know Frisell know that in addition to the &quot;pop&quot; style recordings on this album he also has his &quot;weird Bill&quot; mode where he uses effect pedals to create crazy sounds and feedback. At the end of one of the pieces you could see Bill get a grin across his face and he bent down to adjust some effect pedals and treated the audience to 60s or so of crazy oscillating feedback and noise (I guess he got a bit bored playing simple melodies every night). At the interval I heard the American party talking to each other saying: &quot;It was a shame about the technical issues with his guitar at the end of that tune&quot;... I&#39;m sure Bill would have found that amusing. .",

            "title": "Live at Town Hall and Doña Daisy",
            "content": ". This week we take a bit of a different turn with our coffee. We are for the first time stepping away from roasters located in the UK and moving our sights to Sweden. In particular we are looking at Drop Coffee Roasters located in Stockholm. This has been one of my favourite roasters for many years but getting their coffee to the UK is often expensive (as is true with most of the Scandi roasters). I noticed they had a &quot;free shipping&quot; offer however so wanted to make the most of it. . Now the coffee itself is a bit different for this blog too. In browsing the online shop for which coffees to purchase this one jumped out at me. It was a bit expensive so I had my doubts but thought it had been a while since I bought a higher end coffee so went for it. Unfortunately it wasn&#39;t until I had ordered that I noticed it was a half-bag size instead of a full-bag size. So what was initially &quot;a bit expensive&quot; turned out to be &quot;very expensive&quot;! So this will be by far the most expensive coffee featured on this blog so far. . The coffee itself is from San Jose in Central Valley, Costa Rica. The farm is called Finca Don Pepe and the coffee is called Doña Daisy. The farm is a result of a partnership between Daisy and Pepe Fallas who decided to grow coffee in their garden relatively recently - this is not a coffee from a big farming conglomerate! . As you&#39;d guess from being an expensive coffee (at this level) we are looking at a Gesha varietal - something we have talked about previously in the blog. Gesha is finnicky to grow and finnicky to work with, it requires absolute attention at every stage to get the most out of it. I can&#39;t recall seeing a Costa Rican Gesha before this so it is interesting to see how it behaves. . The processing on this coffee is listed as a natural process by Drop but is described more as a &quot;white honey&quot; process in their literature. We have talked about Honey/Pulped-Natural processing before, the &quot;colour&quot; preceeding the &quot;honey&quot; is used as a descriptor for how much of the cherry is left on the seed. White representing the least amount of cherry left (i.e. the closest to a &quot;washed&quot;) - so I am expecting quite a clean elegant cup profile. Following the honey stage the coffee has been left for 25-32 days to dry, which is fairly long for this processing style. This may help to increase the cup complexity - but only the producer will know for sure why they opt for a longer drying style. . Since I only have a half bag of this coffee I did not try to pull an espresso with it - at the price I did not want to risk a &quot;sink job&quot; with a poorly pulled shot when dialing in. Don&#39;t worry however! There was still plenty of espresso being consumed at JazzCoffeeStuff towers, the coffees in question may appear in next weeks post. . After all that build up let&#39;s get on to the coffee itself. First thing to note about this (and other Drop coffees) is how light the roast is. It is certainly lighter than most other coffees around, if you are more of a medium-light or medium fan this might be a bit much for you. But if like me you enjoy the lighter roasts Drop are always worth a shout. On the dry aroma I get lots of notes, the first thing that came to mind was tangerine. Along with this there are floral notes of jasmine and bergamot and hints of that honey sweetness you get from a pulped. . As usual the filter comes from my Hamasi brewer with (bleached) chemex papers. What is striking about this coffee is its complexity. There is so much going on in the cup. As with a lot of these complex coffees they come alive as they cool. Unfortunately since the roast is so light you need to brew with very hot water. This leaves you like a kid on christmas eve staring at their presents unable to open them, quite a torturous affair. If you don&#39;t let the cup cool enough everything gets a bit muddled and it is difficult to get any flavour separation. If you can hold off long enough you are treated with a truly amazing cup of coffee. In a blind cupping you would likely guess this is an Ethiopian coffee given the major flavour notes are peach and florals. However there is more to it than that, the sweetness is very high - syrupy even. This syrupy character carries through to the mouthfeel too. The tangerine note we had on the nose also comes into play too and gives a big juicy and fruity character to the coffee. As you&#39;d expect with Gesha the florals are ever present too, they come more to the forefront the longer you leave the coffee to cool. The coffee also has a strikingly long aftertaste too described on the tasting notes as &quot;strawberry lemonade&quot; - which is an absolutely perfect description. . Overall this is a great coffee. Whether it is worth the price of admission is up to you - at around 5 times the price of the other coffees featured on this blog, is it really 5 times the coffee? Probably not, but this is true with most &quot;premium&quot; items. . Trying to pick some jazz to pair with such a special coffee is no easy task. In the end I decided to pick Thelonious Monk with his 1959 album &quot;The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall&quot; . . This is Monk&#39;s first appearance on this blog, I wanted to save him for a special occassion. For me no other artist sums up what jazz is all about more than Thelonious Monk. More than that he transcends the genre to become, in my opinion, one of the greatest artists on any medium. It takes a matter of seconds to know you&#39;re listening to Thelonious, even if people try their best to replicate him they never quite nail it - they always sound like a karaoke impersonation. . As some readers to this blog may be relatively new to jazz it is worth giving a brief re-cap on Monk&#39;s history. He first came to prominence in the 1940s as one of the leading fore-fathers of the be-bop movement. Along with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker he helped work out how be-bop could be played - most notably in after hours gigs at Minton&#39;s jazz club in Harlem (if you gave me a time machine this is one of the places/times I would visit just to hear some of those gigs). A little while later during his career he and fellow pianist Bud Powell were caught in a car with drugs in it. Thelonious refused to rat on his friend and so the police took away his cabaret card. Monk apparently heeded the aphorism &quot;snitches get stitches&quot;. By losing his card he was unable to play in the main jazz clubs in NY (any club serving alcohol). This allowed Monk to be effectively shielded from the jazz scene and develop his own sound. Another consequence was it allowed him the opportunity to collaborate with John Coltrane and create some truly great music. In the latter stages of his career he was plagued by mental illness/neurological issues and his behaviour became more and more erratic before his death in 1982. . Monk&#39;s compositions (and playing style) are characterised by their twisting rhythmic constructions and angular sounding melodies. I have to admit the first time I heard Monk I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; it, I heard him too early on in my jazz journey and it was just too much of a stretch at the time. I revisted Monk a few years later and he blew my mind, from then on he became (probably) my favourite jazz artist. . Another big part of the Monk vibe is the humour, there are very few other artists who use humour in the same way. Not only in the sometimes cartoon-ish playful melodies but also when performing. He would often get up and dance while others were soloing, sometimes interrupting his dancing to add a chord stab at an opportune moment without missing a beat. He was also renowned for his fashion/style being particularly associated with hats - this is also picked up on the tribute to Monk by Eric Dolphy in the tune &quot;Hat and Beard&quot;. . The &quot;Town Hall&quot; album was recorded in Feb 1959, it is one of the rare opportunities to hear Monk in a &quot;big band&quot; context. Most of his other works are in quartet and small-band formats. Here he revisits some of his previous tunes but uses the wider soundscape available to him. You can also hear, perhaps most clearly, his love of Duke Ellington being in this context. . There are a number of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; recordings from the concert which give a real insight into Monk&#39;s approach, the particularly interested can hunt these down and you can hear Monk describe the tunes to the band and it is very illuminating. I also remember hearing a story that in the rehearsals for this album one of the musicians was unable to lock into the rhythm and so Thelonious pulled him to one side and preceeded to dance in front of him as a way of portraying the rhythm. This gives a great insight into how to think about these tunes, and with that in mind it gives you a whole fresh perspective on the pieces. . There are 10 musicians appearing on this album so we will not mention all of them. However it is worth noting that this album features a relatively young Donald Byrd on the trumpet, Art Taylor on the drums and is the first collaboration between Monk and Charlie Rouse who played tenor with various Thelonious bands for 10 years. . It&#39;s hard to pick out choice tracks on this recording as all 6 tunes are fantastic. Perhaps the most revered on this album is &quot;Little Rootie Tootie&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). This is quintessetially Monk featuring a twisting rhythmic melody that is both silly yet also completely logical. Up to now we have mostly talked about the fun playful side of Monk, but lest we forget he was also a master at writing hauntingly beautiful sombre tunes. On this album &quot;Monk&#39;s Mood&quot; is probably the best example of this. It manages to conjure up great sadness but at the same time just the right amount of happiness and hope. It is a melody that can rattle around your head for weeks after listening to it and the extended band arrangment adds to the weight behind the melody. . Overall this album belongs in the &quot;essential&quot; category of jazz albums for me. If you have not heard it before do yourself a favour and hunt down a copy (I&#39;d recommend the original 6 track listing above the extended reissues which don&#39;t really add much in my view). .",

            "title": "Rainbow Sign and Debeka",
            "content": ". On the blog this week we are staying in sunny Margate and sticking with the Curve Coffee Roasters. Yet again we&#39;re featuring another Ethiopian coffee, this time a natural process from the Debeka farm - another owned by Israel Degfa (this blog is becoming a bit predictable at this rate). Again we&#39;re in the Oromia region but this time the Borena zone (I believe a blog first). . What makes this coffee particularly interesting however is the varietal: Mundo Novo. This is not a varietal one would usually associate with Ethiopia. Typically Mundo Novo is found in South American regions - most notably Brazil. It has also been introduced to Central America but you don&#39;t see it often there either, reportedly due to the farmers not liking how tall the plants become. In this case Israel received some plants from a friend on a trip to Brazil and decided to plant then at Debeka. Mundo Novo comes from the typica-bourbon lineage and is a natural mutation of a bourbon, as such it inherits a lot of bourbon characteristics: good cup quality but not particularly resistant to pests nor disease. . Moving swiftly on to what matters: the coffee itself. The dry aroma consists of two main components for me: a syrupy rich sweet note like a honey and a soft delicate floral note - I would describe it as a white floral instead of a lavender/violet type floral. Overall it is fairly delicate and is not one that will blow you away on the nose. . As usual we start with the filter. Here the &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;delicate&quot; descriptors certainly come to play. Although this is a natural process it is a very clean cup and you couldn&#39;t describe this one as a &quot;fruit bomb&quot; like some naturals. There are fruit notes however, the typcial apricot/peach notes you expect with Ethiopian coffees but also a hint of a tropical fruit from the processing. The taste notes on the bag call this pineapple, which I feel is fair. The whitefloral notes certainly come out to play in the aftertaste, it reminds me of the jasmine flowers that come out to bloom in early summer. This is a coffee I find very interesting and have enjoyed coming back to, it is so soft that it doesn&#39;t command your attention if you have other things to do but there&#39;s enough intrigue to keep you entertained. Another great filter cup from Curve. . We&#39;ll move onto the espresso here, but before we talk taste notes I&#39;m going to take a brief de-tour into the topic of &quot;puck-prep&quot;. This something that seems to boggle the mind of a novice barista and internet message boards/youtube comments are filled with questions about it. You&#39;ll often find people coming up with increasingly complicated preparations to get a &quot;better&quot; shot. In my experience a lot of it amounts to chasing ghosts and simplicity is the best approach, you want to have something you can repeat day in day out without thinking about it. Your approach should match the equipment you have and the type of coffee you drink. For me WDT (Weiss distribution trick) is worth doing but the other prep types (e.g. the OCD spinner style) are a waste of time. To do WDT you essentially &quot;stir&quot; your grounds within the portafilter, this aims to break up any lumps and ensure that the grounds are well &quot;mixed&quot;. Depending on your grinder you might find that the grind quality changes as you grind coffee (due to different weights of beans being above the burrs, popcorning etc.) You want the puck to be as homogeneous as possible so you give it a little stir. That&#39;s it, very simple... Yet many get this part wrong: first part to consider is the stirrer itself. You can pick these up from various places such as etsy if you search &quot;WDT tool&quot; - but not all tools are created equally. . . In a WDT tool you want to find one with &quot;thin&quot; lugs, if they are made from thick pieces of metal you risk compressing the grinds more and leaving a &quot;hole&quot; when you remove the tool itself. The next thing to consider is the positioning of the lugs themselves, typically you&#39;ll see the lugs being parallel to each other pointing straight down. This gives the tool a very &quot;thin&quot; profile (like the picture above), this is not ideal for mixing the grounds. Instead it&#39;s best if you point the lugs outwards to give a &quot;wider&quot; profile, this will allow for much more efficient mixing. You can do this by gently bending the legs at the body of the tool. Ideally you want the lugs to touch the edges of your basket. With your good &quot;wide&quot; WDT tool it&#39;s time to start mixing, to do this you want to gently make a circular motion so that you bring grinds from the basket walls towards the centre and vice versa. You do not have to spend long doing this; I like to do 10 rotations in a clockwise direction then 10 in an anti-clockwise direction. After this remove the tool, tamp and go. It&#39;s that simple, it should only take a matter of seconds after you get the technique down. I see lots of people say WDT doesn&#39;t make a difference, but also lots of videos of people doing it badly - I do wonder if the two are linked! . Looking at the coffee itself. Again this is the &quot;filter&quot; roasted version of this coffee as is my preference. The roast is fairly light and for filter I use a hand grinder so I can tell these beans are particularly hard. This usually means that a coffee can be a pain to dial in, but actually this one was a pleasure. It is very forgiving and with my setup almost impossible to get it too &quot;wrong&quot;. Unsuprisingly I find it works best with a high temperature and a long pull (1:2.75) which I get through in about 25s. In the cup the same &quot;soft&quot; descriptors come through, it seems to pickup a &quot;melon&quot; type quality in the espresso which I did not notice in the filter. The mouthfeel is big and somewhat creamy in texture. Both acidity and sweetness are medium. In the aftertaste those familiar white florals come through, this seems to be this coffees &quot;signature&quot;. . Overall I&#39;m very happy with this coffee and another solid showing from Curve. This is the last of my current batch from Curve but given the two I&#39;ve had here I&#39;m sure they will appear back on the blog at some point. . For this weeks jazz we&#39;re looking at another 2020 recent release. This time we&#39;re going to Blue Note records and taking on the new Ron Miles album: &quot;Rainbow Sign&quot;. . . For those who have not come across Ron before he is a trumpet player and composer from Denver, Colorado. He first started making records in the late 1980s/early 1990s. He is perhaps best known for his collaborations with guitarist Bill Frisell with whom he has released many albums under both his own name and Bill&#39;s. The line up on &quot;Rainbow Sign&quot; is the same quintet as on the 2017 &quot;I Am A Man&quot; release, namely: . Ron Miles: Trumpet and Cornet | Jason Moran: Piano | Bill Frisell: Electric Guitar | Thomas Morgan: Bass | Brian Blade: Drums | . In terms of modern jazz this is pretty much an &quot;all star&quot; line-up. Each player being regarded as a premier artist in their own right. Ron wrote started writing this album in 2018 while looking after his father at the end of his life. Rather than being a maudlin and sombre affair &quot;Rainbow Sign&quot; instead offers up a loving dedication. The album seems to reflect a spiritual awakening for the trumpeter as he comes to terms with his loss. It seems to offer up hope of eternal peace. . As with many albums in the Miles and Frisell back catalogue it is hard to classify the music. The music seems to start off in one place and then gently transform into something completely different without the listener noticing. Really it is about letting the music take you to a different place rather than diving in to explore the technicalities in this author&#39;s opinion. Ron and Bill are completely on the same page and create new sonic landscapes for us to explore. I often describe the ultimate goal for any artist as creating their own universe and allowing their fans to explore this. I feel this is what separates the merely &quot;very good&quot; musicians to true artists. The Miles/Frisell partnership is capable of this. . On the surface &quot;Rainbow Sign&quot; seems like an easy-going, simple record - one that can simply blend into your day without demanding much attention. However the more you concentrate the more the album gives, dancing between jazz, folk, blues, world-music and more. . The title track (embedded at the top of this post) is one of the more &quot;jazz&quot; focussed pieces. It is characterised by Ron&#39;s beautifully clear and articulate tone giving the melody some weight. Brian Blade is given the chance to swing on this track, perhaps more so than any other track. Elsewhere Blade offers up subtle textures to his playing which is perhaps what he is known best for. Bill and Jason take on the comping duties, each relying on sparsity to give the piece space. It feels like more than a little nod towards Thelonious. . This is followed by &quot;The Rumor&quot; which feels very much like a tune that could have featured in any number of Frisell recordings. The main melody is driven via Bill&#39;s guitar. It has the feel of an old Americana tune (albeit revisited through the lens of modern jazz). The second half of the tune features some of Miles most subtle playing, there&#39;s no hint of ego here - letting Bill take a bit of the limelight. This lifts the piece into a well rounded composition. . The album ends with the piece &quot;A Kind Word&quot; which almost has a &quot;rock&quot; vibe. Knowing that this album is dedicated to his late father this piece feels a bit like a eulogy. This is another great album released in 2020. It is well worth hunting down a copy! .",

            "title": "Hero Trio and Chelbesa",
            "content": "This week we have a new roaster appearing on the blog: Curve Coffee Roasters - https://www.curveroasters.co.uk/ - based in Margate. They have been on my &quot;to try&quot; list for a while but I never got round to it until now. They come with a reputation for roasting some truly great coffees and their pricing is very reasonable. . As you would expect with this blog I stuck with their &quot;filter roast&quot; offerings (they also offer an &quot;espresso roast&quot; option). For me personally I tend to find these speak to me more than the espresso roasts - admittedly you need to work a bit harder to get a good espresso out of one though. . The coffee itself is from the Chelbesa village within the Gedeb Zone of the Oromia Region. of Ethiopia. This coffee is made up from contributions from a number of small holders within the village and the coffee is a washed process. This is generally a recipe for a coffee I will enjoy, washed coffees from this area are generally my &quot;go to&quot;. After a bit of digging it appears this coffee has a cupping score of 89.5 - which is very high! . Without further ado lets get right in to the coffee itself: on the dry aroma I get a sweet honey note paired with the typical floral notes one would expect from this sort of coffee. The aromas are not too strong coming off the grinds, everything is soft and subtle. As we&#39;ve said before on this blog: the dry aroma can give you some indication of a coffees character but does not tell you everything. . As usual starting with our usual filter technique: one word to get us started is &quot;wow&quot;. This coffee is a near perfect example of why washed coffees from this area are so prized. The first thing I notice is an apricot or peach note, a sweet but not too sweet character. These flavours slowly morph into a melon type flavour the more the cup cools. Then of course the florals: bergamot is clearly present along with violets and lavendar in the background. The mouthfeel is soft, creamy but slightly syrupy - it is not one of the very thin washed Ethiopians completely devoid of mouthfeel. As one would expect the aftertaste is a lingering black tea affair. Overall very enjoyable! . Moving onto the espresso. This one I found a little finnicky to dial in, all my shots tasted good but there was a certain astringency in the aftertaste that took a while to sort out. In the end I found a ratio of 1:2.5 was about right - I didn&#39;t want to go superlong with this one since I knew it had a good mouthfeel I didn&#39;t want to go to waste. I went for a pull of around 25s which is reasonably quick but not excessively. The story was the same with the temperature: hot but not super-hot. As a shot many of the notes from the filter came through, however the florals took more of a backseat. With the mouthfeel and the very subtle florals the &quot;honey&quot; descriptor from the dry aroma became more apt. If you&#39;re willing to put the work in you will be rewarded for it with this coffee but I see why they would label this a &quot;filter&quot; roast - certainly not a coffee I&#39;d recommend to the novice barista for espresso. . This is certianly a very good coffee and one I very much enjoyed, hopefully this is representative of what Curve can do - I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be trying them again. . The jazz this week is a 2020 release from Rudresh Mahanthappa called &quot;Hero Trio&quot;. . . Rudresh is an alto-saxophonist based in New York. He is perhaps best known for his work with pianist Vijay Iyer with whom he has collaborated often. As well as regularly featuring in Downbeat polls he is also musical director at Princeton - so quite a pedigree for a modern jazz musician. . For those unfamiliar with his work I would describe Rudresh&#39;s playing as being fairly &quot;outside&quot;, it is technical and wild but at the same time he still respects the music and song structure. I like free jazz but I sometimes struggle with the really avant garde artists who completely throw out all semblance of musical structure. Mahanthappa also spent many years studying Indian classical music - and this often comes out in his playing, however this never comes across as forced. . On the album &quot;Hero Trio&quot; Rudresh pays tribute to some of his favourite artists including: John Coltrane, Keith Jarrett, Ornette Coleman and of course no alto saxophonist would not list Charlie Parker as an influence (Rudresh even released &quot;Bird Calls&quot; in 2015 - an entire album dedicated to Parker). Alongside these jazz stalwarts there are even pieces from Stevie Wonder and Johnny Cash. We should not think of this as simply rehashing a number of standards however, each tune has been majorly reworked and given its own style. The music feels modern while still paying respect to the past - this is certainly not easy to do. . As the album name suggests the band is a trio format consisting of: . Rudresh Mahanthappa - Alto Saxophone | François Moutin - Acoustic Bass | Rudy Royston - Drums | . . Rudresh the band as &quot;superheros&quot; even dressing up the band in suitable costumes for some of the promotional material. Listening to the album it is easy to understand why. The band is totally locked in, this allows them to take real risks in the arrangments. The album feels like being on a rollercoaster, you know you&#39;re in safe hands despite travelling a mile a minute. In a piano-less trio format the band is allowed to really stretch their legs, without chords tying down what is &quot;acceptable&quot; to play Mahathappa (and Moutin) is free to play without inhibition - something he really takes advantage of. The extra space in the mix allows Royston to really flex his chops too, Rudy is one of my favourite current jazz drummers but he is probably more well known for playing sparsely - so it is nice to hear him let loose. . The album kicks off with &quot;Red Cross&quot; a Charlie Parker tune. Whereas Parker&#39;s classic bounces along with a jovial be-bop type rhythm, the Hero Trio goes for a much more direct hard hitting approach. This is somewhat characteristic of the album as a whole - this is music that demands your attention, it&#39;s difficult to imagine this being &quot;background music&quot;. Mahathappa relies on a lot of chromaticism throughout his solo, this along with his phrasing certainly point towards his Indian classical background. It is a sound that is uniquely his, I don&#39;t think you would mistake him for anybody else out there today. One of the &quot;non-jazz&quot; tributes on the album is to the Johnny Cash classic &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. I sometimes find it worrisome when jazz artists take on these really well known tunes. It is very easy for them to become either: instantly forgettable as they don&#39;t take any risks (and it&#39;s just a ploy to sell records) or they use so much reharmonization that the original tune is completely unrecognisable. Thankfully Mahanthappa and crew take on &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; seriously and pay it the respect it deserves. They do not take too many liberties with the melody, instead they play rhythmically instead. This gives the tune some energy and freshness without straying too far away from the spirit of the piece. Of course the solos are free and wild as one would expect, however they are some of the most restrained on the entire album. . The highlight of the album for me however is &quot;The Windup&quot; a Keith Jarrett piece (and one of my all time favourite tunes from the Jarrett songbook). Covering a Jarrett piece without having a single instrument capable of playng chords is certainly a challenge. This really goes to show just how talented Moutin is as a bass player, much of the main melody falls on him and he needs to drive the music forward. At the same time he needs to imply the chords of the piece so that it doesn&#39;t feel &quot;hollow&quot;. About mid-way through the tune when comping Mahanthappa&#39;s solos there is some of the best bass playing you are likely to hear. A truly fantastic acheivement. . This album is another 2020 banger, if you are into jazz you definitely should hunt this album down. For a rank newbie to the world of jazz this might be a bit much as a first step and it&#39;d perhaps be worth familiarising yourself with the source material first - but certainly put this one of the list of albums to catchup on later. I feel this is an album I&#39;ll come back to time and time again. .",

            "title": "Stein Urheim and La Lima",
            "content": "This week we are sticking with Whitstable based roaster Eigthy Seven Plus. This time we have a Peruvian coffee from the La Coipa district, in the north west corner of the country not too far from the border with Ecuador. This is a washed Caturra/Bourbon coffee from a farm called La Lima owned by Eduardo Campos. . As we noted before the roaster takes its name from dealing with coffees with an SCA rating in excess of 87 exclusively. This particular coffee has a score of 88 - the highest currently offered by the roaster. It is also the most expensive they currently have at £15 per 250g - which is still very reasonable for a coffee of this quality - this comes out to around 90p per (large) cup of coffee so compared to what you pay in a cafe a veritable bargain! . I&#39;ve mentioned in the past Peru is not an origin I naturally gravitate towards, I don&#39;t dislike Peru and don&#39;t avoid at all costs but usually other origins speak to me more so I rarely order Peruvians. This year however I have found some fantastic Peruvian coffees. I tend to find that each year there is one origin where the stars have aligned and they produce fantastic coffee. This feels like Peru&#39;s year to me and maybe I&#39;ll start buying more Peruvians from now on. . Without further ado lets get onto what is important: the cup. First things first the dry aroma: I get faint hints of tropical fruits (that I am unable to put my finger on) but really the big notes are: raspberry, apricot and florals. It is quite a delicate aroma, if you want a big bold fruit bomb it might not be for you. This is sophsticated and refined, these are charactersitics I find myself looking for more and more these days. . As usual we will start by looking at the filter, again my usual set up of using my Hasami brewer with chemex papers and relying on a &quot;pulse pour&quot; style technique to avoid excess agitation and so I end up with a super clean cup. The first thing to note is this coffee &quot;grinds coarse&quot; by which I mean for a given grind setting you&#39;ll likely find drawdown is quicker than you expect. If you are a relative coffee novice one of the first things you might try to do is &quot;chase&quot; a specific time for a brew and fine up the grind (I used to do this when I started). I personally think this is a bad idea, I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a &quot;magic&quot; drawdown time that will fix all woes. Instead any adjustment should be by taste alone - and it was clear this coffee liked the shorter drawdown! In all the brewtime I acheieved was around 2:20s on average - many brewguides will tell you to hit 3:00-4:00 for an &quot;optimal&quot; cup. My cup did not suffer from this, in fact I tried to hit a 3:30 drawdown out of curiousity one day and it made the coffee 100 times worse, it became more bitter and harsh and lost a lot of flavour separation in the process. As always your tastebuds are the best measuring device! . As a filter coffee we get a cup that pretty much mimics the dry aroma. It is a delicate affair and shows real sophistication. The major underlying flavour is raspberry, the tartness and acidity along with the sweetness therein. This is supported by the delicate juicy apricot type note (which itself brings more sweetness). Throughout the cup the florals are prominent too, while the cup is hot they take a bit of a back seat but as it cools they come to the front. They remind me mostly of a bergamot Earl-grey type floral but there are also plenty of white jasmine notes too. This coffee really evolves as it cools so try and savour it (if you can). In terms of acidity I&#39;d say it is fairly low (but does not taste flat) and the sweetness high, but the cup is very complex and interesting. Definitely a very enjoyable cup. . Moving onto the espresso, again this is a filter roast so all the usual rules apply. This coffee seems to be slightly lighter in roast compared to the previous Kayon Mountain (from memory and by eye - I don&#39;t own a meter to check this). However I found that it actually benefits from a more &quot;typical&quot; recipe of about 1:2.2 and a medium heat, with a PI time of 10s then a 27s pull - a very &quot;standard&quot; recipe for an espresso and not usually what you expect from a filter roast. As an espresso I found a new note becomes more prominent: Pears. The raspberry note seems less noticable than in the filter but otherwise all the familiar notes appear. Being so subtle some of the florals are a little harder to find but they&#39;re still there, but cold espresso is disgusting so they don&#39;t really get a chance to speak as the drink cools. As such I think while it makes a good espresso this coffee really shines in the filter settings. I don&#39;t drink milky coffee but I imagine this one would struggle to punch through so look elsewhere if you&#39;re looking for a flat-white! . Onto this weeks jazz. This one might be a bit contentious to the jazz purists out there, I could see this causing an &quot;Is this jazz?&quot; argument. Personally I don&#39;t care where the boundaries are - as long as the music is good! And this record is certainly good. It is from 2014 and is on the Norwegian &quot;Hubro&quot; record label: Stein Urheim - Stein Urheim. . . Stein Urheim is a Norwegian jazz guitarist/composer. His self titled album is not his debut album having released (to my knowledge) 2 albums under his own name before this and multiple collaborations. The self titled album marks a bit of a change of direction however. The album is essentially a solo project, Stein plays a number of instruments on the recording (guitars, flutes, harmonica, slide tamboura, fretless bouzouki, gu qin, mandolin, langeleik, charango, banjo, analog synths and effects), there is a brief cameo by Jørgen Træen who adds some synth parts. In essense it is a &quot;one man band&quot; however. . The album was recorded entirely at the home of Ole Bull (a Norwegian violinist of the 1800s) - the space was designed with acoustics in mind with each room being tailored for small band concerts. This is distinctly noticable in the recording as it has a very &quot;warm&quot; sound and does not &quot;feel&quot; like a cold studio enviroment. In fact I would say in terms of recording quality I can&#39;t think of many albums released in the past 20 years or so that come close to having this level of &quot;organic&quot; recording. It is truly a pleasure to listen to, if you can find a vinyl copy I would strongly suggest picking it up as it&#39;s worth listening to on a quality sound system. . The music itself is no slouch either. Each piece is highly ambitious with many layers and interacting tracks. While it would take an eternity to unpick all the key and time signature changes that happen, all this doesn&#39;t really matter. Each piece is essentially a little look into a distinct universe, Urheim takes us on a journey - they are essentially films in musical form. Exact details matter less than the overall &quot;feeling&quot; of each piece. There are many influences throughout the album from the obvious jazz and blues, through traditional folk, surf, western classical and baroque through the middle east, hasidic and eastern musical traditions. The music slowly meanders through these styles but it never sounds forced, it is all done in a respectful and natural way. . One of the standout pieces on the album for me is the 11 minute long &quot;After the Festival&quot; (embedded above). This piece is probably the most playful and joyous on the album, it features folk, flamenco and Carribean elements prominently along with atmospheric drones. Towards the end of the track a simple beautiful melody appears out of the chaos - what is so clever is that this melody has been there (in various forms) throughout the track it&#39;s just been obscured. This is a &quot;trick&quot; that Stein relies on for a few of the tracks on the album and it gives the project a real cohesion which I think makes it such a memorable album. Another stand-out piece is &quot;Beijing Blues&quot; - which as the name suggests is a juxtaposition of eastern-classical and blues traditions, there is even a bit of an Indian raga thrown in for good measure. The subtle use of harmonica towards the end of the track just lifts the whole piece as it slowly morphs into a blues swagger. . This is an album that is very hard to do justice through words, I find listening to it a very visceral experience. You are transported to different worlds when you listen to it. It is an album that rewards those willing to dedicate the 40 minutes or so to listen to it without distraction - I would recommend nothing more than a comfy chair and a big pot of coffee as an accompaniment. However it can also blend into the background of your day, providing a soundtrack to whatever else you are doing. Although it relies on complex arrangement and harmony in places, it is not at all distracting. It is not often you find music that can take on both of these functions. . All in all a superb album that is well worth hunting down. For my money one of the best albums released in the past 10 years and a modern classic. .",

            "content": "This week on the blog we feature a new roaster called &quot;Eighty Seven Plus&quot;, not only are they new to the blog htey are relatively new in general - being set up around 1 year ago. They take their name from their coffee ethos of only using coffees that score in excess of 87 points on the SCA scale. We have talked about the pros/cons of the SCA scale in the past so we won&#39;t start that conversation again - suffice as to say 87 is usually the threshold I look for personally when deciding on a coffee. I think 87 is a good compromise between cup quality and cost, if you limit yourself to only purchasing 90 plus coffees you will have a relatively small number to choose from and you will end up paying a lot! With 87 coffees you can generally purchase them for fairly reasoanble prices but still get some really great flavours. . It&#39;s worth mentioning the company also has an app (via Apple app store/Google play) - I have not used this as despite working in tech I am a bit of a luddite when it comes to using tech. It appears the app allows you to take notes about the coffees and share your tasting notes with the wider community which is quite a nice idea. . The coffee itself is (another) Ethiopian - the 4th in a row for this blog. This time however it is washed whereas the previous were all natural. Given the choice I am typically more of a fan of washed coffees compared to other processing methods since I value cup clarity most of all. Like the preceeding coffees this too is from the Guji zone in the Oromia region. the farm itself is called &quot;Kayon Mountain&quot; - this is a farm I am particularly familiar with and have had coffee from them via many different roasters over the years. As such I have a number of preconceptions about how I expect this one to taste and behave. . Diving right in to the dry aroma: the first thing that hits me is a caramel sort of smell, this is a little unexpected for a coffee like this so it stuck out. However the major notes you would expect from a coffee like this are there: peaches and stone fruits along with florals and a hint of citrus. All coffees from Eighty Seven Plus are labelled as a &quot;filter&quot; roast which I think is fair, this coffee is not quite as light roast as some others I have seen however. As usual we start with a filter in a v60 type funnel with a chemex paper. As I remembered from drinking this coffee in the past the first thing that comes to mind for me is &quot;soft&quot; - the mouthfeel is soft and delicate and the flavours are gentle and do not punch you in the face. As with most washed coffees from this region we are treated to delicate floral notes of lavender and jasmine along with lemon-y citrus and peach notes. As it cools it becomes increasingly &quot;tea like&quot;. However there is a couple of &quot;strange&quot; notes that come back time and time again with Kayon Mountain coffees to me: the first is &quot;strawberry milkshake&quot; - a combination of flavour notes and the softer mouthfeel. And &quot;bubblegum&quot; - in this example it&#39;s rather faint so if I wasn&#39;t expecting it I might not have picked up on it. But for me it is unmistakable. . Moving onto the espresso: this is an Ethiopian washed coffee roasted for filter so there are no prizes for guessing the advice I give for pulling shots on this one! Hot, fast and long are the orders of the day! Owing to the density of Ethiopian beans you&#39;ll likely find that you need to set your grinder &quot;coarser&quot; to achieve the same flow-rate as you would from a central American coffee. In the end I settled on a ratio of 1:2.75 being optimal here. This seemed to be the turning point where the shot didn&#39;t get any sweeter, pulling longer than this just ended up giving thinner mouthfeel. I was pulling these shots in around 22s with a slight pre-infusion of a couple of seconds. With a &quot;shrinking violet&quot; coffee like this without any powerful flavour notes we can often find the espresso gets a bit &quot;bland&quot; - but this one does not suffer that fate. The similar flavour profile from the filter is still there but the &quot;bubblegum&quot; is able to push through a bit more and becomes more noticable. It is a real treat to find washed Ethiopian espressos like this, given a choice this is the style I go for every time. It will come as no surprise that I&#39;ll say I recommend trying this one as an espresso (even though it is considered a filter coffee). . In both the filter and the espresso this coffee is super clean and has a limited clean aftertaste. Overall a strong showing from a new roaster and hopefully indicative of what else they will offer in the future. . Moving onto this weeks jazz. We&#39;re taking a bit of a different approach this time, I am recommending an album that was released yesterday (25th September 2020) - as such I&#39;ve only listened to this a few times so far so I won&#39;t dive too deeply into what is going on since I haven&#39;t had chance to study it yet, perhaps I&#39;ll revisit this one in a later blog once I&#39;ve had chance to fully digest it all and can see if my perceptions change. . The album is called &quot;Tributes&quot; and it is by Nordic saxophonist Marius Neset, released on the German ACT record label. . . Marius Neset is one of the &quot;next generation&quot; of jazz musicians, being 35 years old which is young for a jazz artist these days. He released his first album in 2008 and has 11 albums to his name currently (plus a few more as a co-leader or guest slots). I first came across him via his &quot;Golden Xplosion&quot; album in 2011 - a truly fantastic album, a little rough around the edges but it was pretty clear to me he was destined to be a leading name in jazz as he matured. After a few more great albums (including the terrific &quot;Sun Blowing&quot; with Lars Danielsson) I had very high hopes for him. But his last few albums disappointed me a little. They were not terrible but he seemed to get a little lost, the high octane energy he was known for initially disappeared and the compositions - while nice - did not set the world on fire. With &quot;Tributes&quot; however he appears to have worked out how to balance the energy with solid composition and he has created the album I have been waiting for from him. . The Neset sax style is clearly very influenced by Michael Brecker, as most modern sax players are, however he combines this with a strong influence of chamber music (and various other European classical movements). On &quot;Tributes&quot; as the name suggests it appears he is trying to pay homage to his idols. Brecker clearly makes an appearance, but there are also strong Rollins influneces, Coltrane, and countless others. However it is done via the Neset lens - it always sounds like him and never as a cheap impersonation. While on some of his earlier records he let the fire-breathing solos take over - here Neset is always serving the music and deploys wildness only when it is required. . On this album he is supported by the Danish Radio Big Band (conducted by Miho Hazama) - this allows him to use the big band to create an expansive soundscape to support the composition. It is extremely accomplished and done masterfully throughout. . Given this album is only a day old finding clips via Youtube to embed is a challenge. The album itself is composed of 2 longer multi-part compositions (which are the true highlights for me) along with 3 shorter pieces. At the start of this blog post we embedded the title track. This one is probably the most similar to previous Neset offerings, you can really hear the chamber music influences and the big band is shown off to the full extent. Marius takes a sublime soprano solo, which is adventurous but fits into the backdrop created by the big-band seamlessly. He manages to resist the urge to throw all his chops at the piece, something that a lot of younger players (and older players too) often struggle with. The real stars of the album are the two extended pieces: &quot;Bicycle Town&quot; which is a hark back to the sound he crafted on the &quot;Pinball&quot; album of 2015. Michael Brecker being a clear influence with the choppy sound and use of ghost notes along with the use of symmetric and diminished scales throughout. The two parts of this composition is where he can really stretch his legs and play the most soaring and technically advanced solos on the entire album. Showing he still has the chops to be considered one of the best on the scene. &quot;Children&#39;s Day&quot; is the other multi-part composition which (after a slow build) descends into a calypso and cuban feel, very reminiscent of &quot;St Thomas&quot; by Sonny Rollins. However this is combined with a complicated harmonic and rhythmic landscape and more &quot;Neset-isms&quot;. It is perhaps the most adventurous on the album and probably my favourite piece as a result. The longer the piece goes on the more the main melody gets distorted and the composition takes on a life of its own before coming back round at the end for a final big crescendo. . Overall I am very impressed with this album and I&#39;m sure this is going to be one I listen to regularly in the next few weeks/months. After a couple of listens I don&#39;t like to make grandiose statements but I feel this has potential to be up there with the best albums released in the last few years. Hopefully this marks a new era for Neset and he can live up to his potential. If you get a chance I strongly suggest you pick up a copy of this album through whatever means you use to purchase your music. .",

            "title": "Way Out West and Bale Mountain",
            "content": "After a brief hiatus JazzCoffeeStuff is back! We are once again looking at a coffee from the fine folks at PLOT roasting - who are fast becoming a regular fixture on this blog. Like the preceeding two posts we have yet another coffee from the Israel Degfa company, again from Ethiopia - this time West Arsi Zone, Oromia - and another natural process. This one is called &quot;Bale Mountain&quot;. This is a single farm coffee - that is every coffee bean here is from the Bale Mountain farm. This is fairly rare for Eithiopian coffees where it is common for a single washing station to process coffees from multiple individual farmers. . We have mentioned Israel and his company a few times in the past weeks, it is about time we talk about this a little more. From what we have seen so far Israel owns many farms and washing stations in the area. You may have come to the conclusion that this is somehow &quot;big business&quot; and somehow exploitative. This is not the case, specialty coffee allows farmers to get more for their crops than they would via other avenues (I&#39;m not saying specialty is the perfect system by any means, but compared to the alternatives it is better!) Israel and company also works directly with the local communities, offers finance to farmers to help them get started and also provides education and even builds schools in the local areas. While not a &quot;pure&quot; charity it does appear Israel does good for the people of Ethiopia and should be commended for that. . Moving onto the coffee itself - this is a bit of a memory test for me since I no longer have this coffee in front of me. Usually I write these pieces while drinking the coffee itself but recently life has got in the way of the blog and so this comes a bit late - but this coffee was so special I had to give it some kudos. The dry aroma on the nose I get a lot of floral notes but also a good whack of really sweet fruitiness. The aroma is quite powerful so suggests we could be in for a flavour-bomb of a coffee. As usual diving into the filter, the first thing I notice is that it is not nearly as punchy as the dry aroma suggested. It is a refined and elegant cup, it&#39;s not a super funky boozy natural like you sometimes find with Ethiopians. The major flavour note for me is strawberry - PLOT decided to use a &quot;red&quot; colour scheme for the label of this one and it is clear to see why. There are other fruity notes too but strawberry is by far the most prominent. It is very very sweet, if you like sugary sweet coffees this one is for you! The label says &quot;honey&quot; as a flavour note but for me it is more of a cotton candy sweetness - I associate honey with the texture as much as the flavour and there is little in the way of syrupy mouthfeel on show here. In addition to this there is a perfumed floral note, particularly in the aftertaste, it is really quite noticable and makes the cup super interesting. The balance between fruit and floral changes significantly with temperature and you can spend ages trying to unpick the flavours if that is your thing. Equally it is not so complex that it is distracting either. . Moving on to the espresso. It was fairly obvious where this one would like to be dialed in to, if you&#39;ve read my advice on filter roasts used as espresso before you can guess what I&#39;ll suggest: pull long, pull fast, pull hot! This one didn&#39;t need to go super long into lungo territory but it was on the long side. The flavour profile was similar to the filter; strawberry at the front, floral at the back. Again it&#39;s super sweet and it is not too acidic. It has a sort of mellowness in the espresso, it&#39;s elegant and refined. This is what I really enjoy in (good) Ethiopian espressos. Overall was very sad to see the back of this coffee. I guess you would expect a comparison to the previous Israel Degfa from PLOT (the Gelana gesha) - it&#39;s very hard to pick a favourite. They were both fantastic and really quite different prospects - if I had to choose I&#39;d give the gesha the edge but you cannot go wrong with either and they&#39;re both worth buying if they&#39;re available as you read this. . Moving onto the jazz this week. When JazzCoffeeStuff was on hiatus the jazz world was celebrating one of its greatest contributors: Sonny Rollins who turned 90 years old on September 7th. To celebrate this milestone this week we are looking at one of my favourite albums of all time: &quot;Way Out West&quot; released in 1957 on Contempary Records. . . At this stage nothing needs to be said about Rollins and his legacy, I don&#39;t believe anybody would consider him anything other than an &quot;all time great&quot;. His reputation far exceeds that of jazz, he&#39;s known as a commentator (very recently penning an interesting article in the NY Times about current global events and whether that leads to personal change) as well as a cultural icon - you have to have a certain level of recognition to be a major character in an episode of The Simpsons (and lets be honest: Bleeding Gums Murphy is himself a not so subtle homage to Rollins). With a recording and touring career spanning 65+ years he has played with just about every major artist in the post-bop era (and many from the be-bop era too) as well as having a string of albums under his own name. . The album we&#39;re looking at here is &quot;Way Out West&quot; - one I always find myself coming back to. It is a bit of an oddball in the Rollins back catalogue, he explores americana, country and western swing through the lens of be-bop. This gives the album its own personality which I like! It&#39;s a shame Sonny didn&#39;t revisit these ideas often but I guess any attempts to do this might feel a little forced. . The album cover is one of my favourite album covers of all time. Sonny fully leans into the &quot;cowboy&quot; theme with gun holsters and a cowboy hat. The humour is something that is found throughout the album, the music is of course serious in terms of composition and harmony but it does not mean you can&#39;t have fun with it. Jazz has the impression of being &quot;serious&quot; so it is nice to listen to these &quot;lighter&quot; records on occassion. &quot;Way Out West&quot; does have provenance too however, it is the first album to feature a trio of the form: sax-bass-drums. This is now ubiquitous, it&#39;s hard to picture a time when this would have been considered ground-breaking. By forgoing an &quot;accompanying&quot; harmonic instrument such as piano or drums a lot of space is opened up in mix which allows Sonny to improvise much more freely - which for an improviser as prolific as Rollins is certainly a good thing! . The album opens up with the track &quot;I&#39;m An Old Cowhand&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog) which was originally penned by Johnny Mercer in 1936. While the woodblock &quot;horse&quot; sounds are a little cheesy the track itself is masterfully done. Rollins takes the main melody of the tune and looks at it through the lens of be-bop - the accents and timing are essentially textbook Charlie Parker. However he resists the temptation to up the tempo (as many would have) - this combined with the sparse arrangement of having only bass and drums in the rhythm section means Sonny can have complete freedom over the tune: he can lean into the groove at points but then breathe fire on a solo for effect. By all accounts this should just be a silly, gimmicky sort of tune to fill up space on an album - but the magic of Sonny is he can elevate this into something magical. For contrast you can see the original performance of &quot;I&#39;m An Old Cowhand&quot; from 1936 in the film &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot; (with Bing Crosby singing). It&#39;s a long way away from Sonny&#39;s interpretation! While the western vibe is prominent on 3 of the 5 album tracks (the track above, another western standard &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot; and the Rollins penned &quot;Way Out West&quot;) - this is balanced with some simply sublime ballad playing. I&#39;ve said it in this blog before: I consider being able to play ballads a real test of an improvisers skill. The second track on this album is a beautiful interpretation of Duke Ellington&#39;s 1934 &quot;(In My) Solitude&quot;. This has been recorded multiple times over the years by a range of artists - but the version on &quot;Way Out West&quot; is the definitive version for me, the version I think of whenever anybody mentions the tune. Sonny manages to perfectly capture the haunting beauty in the piece while somehow providing just a glimmer of hope. It is an absolute masterclass in improvising over a ballad, and for me personally some of Sonny&#39;s best playing. So far we have (rightly) been focussed on the man himself, but it is time to recognise the bass playing and &quot;give the drummer some&quot;. . On the bass we have Ray Brown - who is a legend in his own right. Having recorded with artists through the late big-band era, through be-bop then post-bop and beyond. He is perhaps best known for his work with Oscar Peterson and Ella Fitzgerald who he recorded with on multiple albums. He also has countless recordings as a leader/co-leader. Without a harmony instrument in the line-up the role of the bass player becomes crucial, often in larger ensembles the bass player has the function of keeping things grounded. In a small trio format like this that changes to driving the tune forward (which may otherwise fall to a piano player) - this was the first time anybody played in this way on record. Ray does it masterfully, I find his playing on Solitude in particular superb but he is consistently brilliant on every track. It would be very easy for this trio format to fall down by a bass player being too sparse, fortunately this is not the case here. . The drummer on this album is Shelly Manne - again somebody who can be considered a legend in their own right. Manne is most associated with the west coast jazz scene. In the US during the 40s-60s (roughly) there was east and west coast schools of jazz (perhaps a pre-cursor to east and west coast rap?) The west coast typically focussed on the &quot;cool jazz&quot; sound, relaxed and laid back. But also the west gave rise to some of the more avant-garde artists too - Shelly played with both the cool and avant extensively. Aside from his own work he is probably remembered most for his work with Chet Baker. On &quot;Way Out West&quot; in addition to the &quot;horse sounds&quot; with the wood block he also unleashes pure swing. In this small trio format the bass player has to &quot;cover&quot; for the harmony instruments and so the swing is largely driven by the drummer - there are few as well equipped for this role than Shelly. The fearlessness of Sonny Rollins as a leader cannot be overstated here. Not only did he invent this new trio format (which has since been copied by pretty much every major sax player since at some point in their career) - he did so with 2 musicians in Brown and Manne who he hadn&#39;t worked with before. I think this adds to the spontaneous and playful atmosphere throughout the album. . To finish I&#39;ll leave you with another country tune: &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot; - another examination of a piece of americana through the lens of be-bop. . &quot;Way Out West&quot; is one of my favourite albums of all time, so I strongly suggest you pick up a copy via whichever medium you use to purchase your music! .",

            "title": "Riverside and Saint Semeon Abay",
            "content": "This week we are featuring a new (for the blog) roaster: Saint Coffee Roasters. Their roastery is located in Hackney, London and they have a number of cafes across the capital including Baker Street, Angel and Camden. I decided to give them a try based on this coffee in particular. . The coffee in question is an Ethiopian coffee from the Israel Degfa company (as our previous one was also). From the Adola washing station from the Aferara region of the Guji zone. It has been designated an &quot;experimental natural&quot; process - also known as a &quot;bag process&quot; whereby the coffee cherries are left to ferment in a polypropylene bag (rotating every 12 hours). This (reportedly) leads to increased development of intense fruity flavours. This particular example has an SCA score of 90.25 - regular readers at this point will know an SCA score is not the be all and end all but a score above 90 places the coffee in the top 1% of coffee globally. High praise indeed! Given this the price of the bag was fairly reasonable. . In ordering this coffee there was a bit of a royal mail mishap and my original package got so wet that the address label rubbed off and sent back to Saint (it begs the question what on earth royal mail were doing with it!) Saint were quick to correct this and sent an additional bag of coffee by way of an apology - this is certainly a good way to resolve the issue from my side so I&#39;m giving them a shout out here! . Moving swiftly onto the coffee itself: the dry aroma gives a very big hit of chocolate/cocoa, that is the overiding note with some lighter fruitynotes hidden in the background. This coffee is roasted marginally darker than some of the roasters commonly featured in this blog, it is by no means &quot;medium&quot; but it is certianly &quot;omni&quot; as opposed to the &quot;filter&quot; styles usually featured, this will likely bring out these cocoa notes a bit more. As usual we start with a filter; as the dry aroma suggested the cocoa is a big part of this coffee and there is a big body and mouthfeel to go with it. There are the usual &quot;natural&quot; tropical fruit or bubblegum notes present but they&#39;re not as funky and as in your face as you might expect. Actually I find myself using &quot;black forest gateau&quot; as the most predominent descriptor here. As the cup cools the fruity notes come more to the front and the cocoa subsides. Overall it is fairly complex and there&#39;s a lot to pick apart here, for a natural it is also very clean tasting. . Into the espresso, here I toyed around with shorter shots trying to make the most of the cocoa notes and body but it fell a bit flat for me, the complexity was lost. In the end I settled on pulling a little longer around 1:2.75 - at a medium heat with a decent preinfusion. This sacrificed a little in mouthfeel and body but more than made up for it in sweetness. As a coffee I found it very easy to dial in and was very forgiving. It seemed to be quite insensitive to grind size change, I had to move my settings quite a lot to notice a difference with this coffee. In the cup the tropical fruits came out a little bit more, however it is not a &quot;loud&quot; coffee and don&#39;t go expecting real deep funky notes. The &quot;black forest&quot; vibe is certainly still there and still the first thing I notice when tasting. Again it is a clean coffee and the aftertaste does not linger too long. . Overall a complex and interesting coffee and one I&#39;m glad I picked up. . For the jazz this week we are heading back to 2014 through the &quot;Riverside&quot; album from Dave Douglas and Chet Doxas. . . In this project Douglas and Doxas pay tribute to Jimmy Giuffre. However unlike many other &quot;tribute&quot; albums this album is not just a rehash of Giuffre&#39;s tunes: instead all but 2 tracks are originals. There is only one Giuffre composition (&quot;The Train and the River&quot;) and one Johnny Mercer standard (&quot;Travelin&#39; Light&quot;) which was a favourite of Giuffre. While the back catalogue of Jimmy Giuffre is fairly broad (from big band, through cool and even free-jazz) - on &quot;Riverside&quot; they pay homage to the blues-folk influenced stylings, but in a more &quot;modern&quot; style. . The line up on the album is: . Dave Douglas - trumpet | Chet Doxas - clarinet, saxophone | Steve Swallow - electric bass | Jim Doxas - drums | . Dave Douglas is a fairly &quot;big&quot; name in modern jazz. His back catalogue is extensive covering just about every jazz sub-genre you can think of and has worked with many other artists both old and new: from John Zorn, Bill Frisell, Lee Konitz, Joe Lovano, Horace Silver and many others. He also has a background as an educator working with various universities and music institutions and also has his own record label &quot;Greenleaf Music&quot; (on which &quot;Riverside&quot; is released) which is one of my favourite current jazz labels. It is hard to summarize the Douglas &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;style&quot; in a way that does him justice given the breadth of his experience - however he typically focuses on a powerful big sound and often plays with a great deal of swagger. If you ever get a chance to see him perform live (regardless of the project) you should jump at it, he always puts on a show and is one of the most consistent out there. I try and catch him when he comes to town. . &quot;Riverside&quot; appears under both Douglas and Doxas names - I have to be honest I know very little about Chet Doxas (and his brother Jim on drums). He has a relatively small back catalogue - but I&#39;ve enjoyed everything I&#39;ve heard to date. It may be a case that &quot;less is more&quot;! . Steve Swallow is the &quot;veteran&quot; of this line up; having worked from 1960 onwards. In fact he previously worked with Jimmy Giuffre fairly extensively which gives this album an air of authenticity. He is also known for working with Paul Bley, John Scofield, Steve Kuhn, Carla Bley and Gary Burton (among others) and has a sizeable career as a leader. He was one of the first jazz bassists to move to electric bass exclusively - and one of only a select few who plays a 5 string bass. He has a style that I would describe as intricate but relaxed, often opting to play chords when comping and playing in the very high register when soloing. He genuinely plays softly with contemplation rather than opting for big powerful bass lines. It is a sound all to himself and is instantly recognisable. . On &quot;Riverside&quot; the writing duties are split roughly 50:50 between Douglas and Doxas and the album has essentially 2 speeds: an upbeat chaotic swing of Douglas and the slower more meditative approach of Doxas. &quot;Handwritten Letter&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) is a prime example of the Douglas approach. The main melody is an uptempo high energy affair but there are many twists and turns as the tune progresses. The rhythmic interplay is a key feature of the album and brings a playful feel to proceedings. The tune &quot;Old Church, New Paint&quot; shows off the groups softer side with a down-tempo comtemplative ballad with a nod towards gospel. Doxas plays with a beautiful breath-y tone, meanwhile Douglas playing some great counter-point. The use of counter-point melody is something that appears frequently throughout the record. The rhythm section of Doxas and Swallow keeps the whole tune swinging with a blues tilt. There is a lead-in track to this piece that features a beautiful solo from Steve Swallow and gives him a chance to flex some of his chops, something that does not appear too often on this album with Douglas and Doxas taking most of the limelight. . Overall it is a fantastic album, slightly overlooked at the time so well deserving of a second listen. This is the sort of album that can satisfy in a number of ways: it is quite &quot;easy&quot; to listen to as it is focussed on blues-folk yet behind this there are some really interesting rhythmic and counter-point ideas should you want to investigate further. There has since been a second album for the Riverside project called &quot;The New National Anthem&quot; where they look at the work of Carla Bley - also worthy of your time. .",

            "title": "The Real McCoy and PLOT Gelana Gesha",
            "content": "Welcome to the 20th JazzCoffeeStuff post! . This week we are back to PLOT coffee roasting again. If you have read the previous blog posts you&#39;ll notice that (at the moment) there is little variation in roasters appearing on this page: this is intentional given the global situation. I recommend everybody support the businesses they like as it is a tough time for coffee roasters. As such I&#39;m doing less &quot;exploring&quot; and am spending more of my coffee money on the usual suspects. . Onto more positive notes: this week the coffee we&#39;re looking at is kind of interesting. It is a coffee from Ethiopia and from the Israel Degfa empire. I (partly) joke about calling it an empire, Israel owns a company Kerchanshe Trading who own a number of washing stations and mills throughout Ethiopia. If you are looking at high quality coffee from this region it won&#39;t take you long to come across the Israel Degfa name. Over the past few years he has been working tirelessly to improve the quality of coffee being produced. . In this instance the coffee we&#39;re looking at today is a natural process from the Gelana woreda in the (west) Guji zone of the Oromia Region. Guji is highly synonymous with high quality coffee and has featured on this blog in the past. Gelana is a small area that benefits from decent rainfall and fertile soil which is a good starting point for growing high quality coffee plants. Israel decided that this particular farm was a prime location to experiment and decided to plant a large number of Gesha plants. . We have talked about varietals in the past, but I believe this is the first Gesha we have featured on the blog. Gesha first came onto the scene around 2004 through the prized Panama farm Hacienda La Esmeralda. On the cupping table it produced such vibrant floral notes that many thought somebody had &quot;smuggled&quot; some Ethiopian coffee onto the table and it couldn&#39;t possibly be produced in Panama. This sparked an obssession with the varietal and quickly Gesha lots became the hottest lots in auctions reaching crazy price levels. Through the end of the 2000s and 2010s barista competitions essentially became &quot;Gesha shows&quot; - if you wanted to place you needed to have a special Gesha coffee to show off! But what is so special about Gesha itself? It originally hails from Ethiopia, first identified in the 1930s, samples got sent to Costa Rica in the 1950s and Panama planted samples as early as 1960s. The Gesha varietal is synonymous with &quot;floral&quot; notes particularly jasmine and bergamot and is almost always fruit focussed. They tend to be very perfumed with a big bouquet, as a result they regularly score in the 90s for SCA cup scores (remember 80 is the cutoff for specialty, getting into the 90s is incredibly rare &lt;1% of coffee produced each year globally gets into this bracket - essentially the best of the best). . What is particularly interesting about this coffee from PLOT is the price; for a Gesha it is simply outstanding value - it is the same price as their &quot;regular&quot; coffees. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever found a Gesha at this price point before so I was very eager to try it. Although I admit I was a little skeptical, like if you find a Ferarri in the autotrader for £1000. But given the last few coffees from PLOT I considered this a &quot;risk&quot; worth taking. . As a dry aroma from the ground beans the fragrance is a little subdued, this is something I regularly notice about Gesha coffees - they tend to be quite &quot;polite&quot; and never punch you in the face. There is certainly a peach note and also, as expected, the jasmine floral note. Another thing I instantly notice: this coffee is a very light roast, this is certainly one you could consider the mythical &quot;nordic roast&quot; style. Onto the filter, as usual a chemex filter type, the resulting coffee is clean as they come, there isn&#39;t a hint of &quot;funk&quot; from the natural processing. I would describe the flavour profile as relatively subtle but certainly complex. The main overiding flavour note for me is peach, it is like biting into a ripe juicy peach. As the cup cools the florals come out to play and it takes on an elderflower cordial sort of vibe - the sweetness of this coffee taking on that sticky almost jammy quality. What I found most astounding however was the aftertaste: out of nowhere a ripe banana note comes out. It is only evident in the aftertaste and there is no hint of it before, it is really suprising but unmistakable for me. This is a note that PLOT did not list on the bag but for me it&#39;s one of the major characters of the coffee. . Moving onto the espresso, a coffee roast this light can be a nightmare to dial in and you&#39;re left with a &quot;sweetspot&quot; living on a knife-edge with even the slightest change in puck-prep throwing the whole shot off. Fortunately this one was surprisingly easy to dial in on my setup, I didn&#39;t have any issues at all. In the end I settled for a 1:2.75 ratio out in 24s with my machine on maximum temperature. As with the filter the major flavour note for me was peach, the shot was super sweet with just enough acidity not to be cloying. Again it was a super clean flavour profile and there was little in the way of body or mouthfeel. Again the ripe banana note came out during the aftertaste but was slightly less pronounced in the espresso, the aftertaste of the filter lingered whereas the aftertaste of the espresso was fairly shortlived. . Overall this was a very interesting and delicious coffee. On the face of it a very simple delicate flavour profile but there was enough complexity there to keep you entertained too. It is certainly worth trying if it is still available as you read this. . For the jazz this week we are heading back to 1960s Blue Note with a hard-bop classic from McCoy Tyner: &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; . . McCoy Tyner is probably best known for being the pianist in the John Coltrane band - where he featured on many seminal albums such as &quot;My Favourite Things&quot;, &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; and &quot;Love Supreme&quot;, all of which are worthy of a blog post to themselves. He also had many other dates as a sideman for the likes of Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan, Hank Mobley, Freddie Hubbard and Joe Henderson along with many others. Today however we are focussed on his solo career which was equally prolific. &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; was released in 1967, some 2 years after he left the John Coltrane band. It was during this time he began to find his own voice as a leader. . It is safe to say McCoy is certainly in the &quot;modal&quot; school of post-bop jazz - for those who do not know music theory: a mode is essentially a degree of a scale, for example taking the major scale (&quot;do, ri, me, ...&quot;) there are seven associated &quot;modes&quot; of this scale depending on which note is the root (&quot;home&quot; note). Each mode has its own flavour/mood, in a modal composition we take a specific mode and build the entire tune around that, this gives pieces a specific &quot;mood&quot; or &quot;feeling&quot;. This is in contrast to, say, be-bop where the focus is on chord changes and the melody follows the structure of the chord and so a composition may feature many different scales in passing. Modal jazz became very popular with post-bop artists and even many modern records still use a modal concept. . Another factor of McCoy&#39;s playing is his powerful left hand playing, he often relies on big choppy chords to drive the pieces forward. This often brings an authoritative punch to the compositions and drives the music forward. There is a certain &quot;stride&quot; influence to this but it is certainly his own sound and it is unmistakable, you can often hear other players doing a &quot;McCoy impression&quot; but never quite getting it right. Of course another big part of his playing is his reliance on fourth intervals that appear throughout his work, many of his chord voicings are based around the idea of stacking fourths - he even has an album named &quot;Reaching Fourth&quot; so they clearly meant a lot to him. . Let&#39;s look at the rest of the line up on this album now: . McCoy Tyner - piano | Joe Henderson - tenor saxophone | Ron Carter - bass | Elvin Jones - drums | . As with the majority of albums featured on this blog: this line up is stellar. . If you have read any of the previous blog posts you&#39;ll know about Joe Henderson at this point, one of my favourite artists of all time. As you&#39;d expect Joe&#39;s improvisation is top notch playing some really intricate and interesting lines, he doesn&#39;t get quite as &quot;free&quot; as he does on his own albums (understandably) but he matches perfectly the energy of Tyner throughout. Joe is one of those players who is equally talented as a sideman (by not taking the spotlight away from the named artist) and leading a band himself. . Then on the bass there is Ron Carter, again a legend who has appeared on this blog on numerous posts (although not yet as a solo artist). The magic in Carter&#39;s playing for me is his ability to accompany other players, it is an often underappreciated skill. The best accompanists have a quality that I like to describe as &quot;holding up a mirror&quot; where they manage to allow the soloing musician to sound &quot;even more like themselves&quot; - Ron has this ability in abundance. This is certainly on display in this album where you have McCoy&#39;s compositions being fairly harmonically dense and frantic solos from McCoy and Joe - if Ron came to the session with ego and not willing to allow the others to speak it could quickly turn into a car crash. The other aspect of Carter&#39;s playing that is so impressive to me is his command of rhythm, he can really find the pocket when things get complicated. He is certianly deserving of his reputation as one of the finest bass players in jazz. . Lastly we have drummer Elvin Jones. Without doubt one of my absolute favourite drummers of all time. Like McCoy, Elvin spent much of his early career playing as a sideman with some of the great artists: in the 1950s with Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins (appearing on the &quot;A Night at the Village Vanguard&quot; - an all time classic) and the 1960s appearing in the John Coltrane band alongside McCoy. Again the list of artists and albums he has worked with and on is basically a &quot;who&#39;s who&quot; of jazz. His playing style is very fluid, playing legato like phrases on the drums. This gives him a rubbery slippery sound that influenced jazz (and other genres) for decades afterwards and still to this day. He manages to maintain this quality while playing sophisticated polyrhymic ideas, which is not easy to do. With complex ideas like this it is very easy for the drumming to begin to sound &quot;robotic&quot; but Elvin keeps things swinging. However Elvin also had the ability to play thunderous and powerful lines when required, he was far from a &quot;one trick pony&quot;. Without a doubt one of the best drummers of all time, not just in the jazz world. . The album starts with &quot;Passion Dance&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog) which is the opening track and one of the album&#39;s highlights. It is a fairly dense piece with a complicated melody, however it is essentially a blueprint on band interaction and connection. Each player is solely concerned with lifting the music and not themselves. This is perhaps most evident with the rhythmic interplay between McCoy and Elvin. Joe takes a blistering solo too, tap-dancing through the chaos to play something beautiful. This focus on connection is evident throughout the album, while some of the other compositions may be less manic there is always a sense of cohesion and togetherness. . Another tune that sticks out for me on this album is the closing track: &quot;Blues on The Corner&quot; As the name suggests this is a take on the blues, however as you&#39;d expect it is a little more sophisticated than that. While Elvin showed off his power in &quot;Passion Dance&quot; here he shows just how hard he can swing on a blues. Ron is playing with complete attitude too which gives McCoy the freedom to explore harmonically while keeping things grounded. Joe also takes the opportunity to play with his characteristic wolf notes and &quot;outside&quot; playing, it is perhaps one of the best solos he&#39;s taken and with his repertoire that is really saying something. . While the 2 tunes outlined here are fairly up-tempo and wild, this album also features 2 beautiful ballads. I find the modal paradigm really lends itself to ballads - it is very easy to create a &quot;mood&quot; and give the piece some character. On this album we have &quot;Contemplation&quot; and &quot;Search for Peace&quot; both of which are fantastic example of hard-bop ballads. Overall you cannot go wrong with any track on this album each one is a classic. This makes, in my opinion, &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; absolutely essential listening for anybody interested in jazz. .",

            "title": "Burn and Assembly Izuba",
            "content": "This week we have the last of my current batch of Assembly roasted coffee in the form of Izuba a washed Bourbon varietal from Burundi. To those familiar with previous blog posts may be having a sense of deja-vu at this point: Burndi as an origin has featured multiple times, many of the coffees featured are washed process and of course Assembly is a reliable blog favourite. . As regular readers will know, Assembly decorate each coffee with a &quot;swirl&quot; which somewhat reflects the flavour profile of the coffee for this coffee we have: . . This coffee gets its name from the washing station where it was processed. The Izuba washing station is located in the city of Kayanza within the Kayanza province in the north of the country, not too far from the border with Rwanda. Typically specialty coffees are named after the &quot;smallest&quot; identifiable characteristic - in this case the coffee is named after the washing station since this coffee is made up of many small lots of local farms. In contrast other coffees could be named after a particular farm (e.g. in the Americas typically you&#39;ll see &quot;Finca ....&quot; - the Spanish for farm). In very high end coffees you might see a farm name followed by a lot number (or farm name followed by a varietal) which denotes a specific part of a specific farm. In cheaper coffees you might only see a region name (e.g. Ethiopia Sidamo) since there is no addtional provenance available. In (typically non specialty grade) you&#39;ll simply get a country name or sometimes not even that! But there is a slight caveat here: some roasters like to name their coffees, essentially as a form of branding, that have nothing to do with the farm/coffee itself. However you can usually find out the details by going onto the roasters website or provided literature with the coffee. . A big part of the specialty coffee movement is transparanency so generally the more detailed the better! However this has essentially nothing to do with quality in the cup, you might find a coffee from a very precise lot of a farm and have all the information in the world but still not particularly enjoy the taste. As always these &quot;sign posts&quot; should help you get a feel for whether a roaster is offering quality specialty grade or whether they care about their product, but not much more than that. At the end of the day it&#39;s your taste preferences that matter, there are plenty of objectively high quality roasters who just don&#39;t do it for me (and as a result will not feature on this blog!) . Enough blabbering on; onto the coffee itself. Upon grinding the dry aroma of this coffee gives off a fruity vibe as you often expect from washed African coffees. Likely owing to its location it certainly shares a similarity to a Rwandan coffee in terms of aroma. I would describe the fruit note as being quite heavy with a dark grape or plum. There is also a faint caramel/fudge note but it doesn&#39;t immediately jump out. Overall it is not an aroma monster but is very pleasant, refined and elegant. As usual diving into a filter coffee (prepared in my usual way). First thing I notice is red wine, I almost always get this note with Burundi coffees it seems. On the taste notes assembly say &quot;Pomegranate&quot; which I think is the same note, but for me it is more wine-y owing to the heavy nature of this coffee and I did not have the refreshing &quot;zing&quot; I associate with a pomegranate. It is like a full bodied oaky red, very satisfying. There are complexities there too however, there is certainly some faint florals that jump in and out as the cup cools. A little hard to put your finger on exactly what type of floral but it&#39;s certainly there. The sweetness comes through in the form of fudge, I think owing to the texture too. For a washed coffee it is a &quot;big&quot; feeling coffee, not necessarily in terms of mouthfeel but certainly in body - it tastes huge. On the acidity scale I would say this is a medium (at least for a washed African coffee) there&#39;s certainly some there but it&#39;s not a &quot;screw your face up - battery acid&quot; coffee. . Moving onto the espresso: this coffee was an absolute delight to dial in. I found it unbelievably forgiving, it was basically impossible to pull anything less than great on my set up. I eventually settled on a very &quot;typical&quot; 1:2 ratio in around 27s - for a filter roasted washed African this is not typical. I found that pulling like this maintained the &quot;huge&quot; feeling and gave enough mouthfeel to be really enjoyable. Pulling longer was still good but I lost a bit of texture and the espresso was already sweet enough in the shorter pull so it didn&#39;t offer much improvement there. In the cup I found that the fudge/toffee notes jumped out a bit more but the red wine was still the main note for me. The subtle florals I picked out in the filter were totally overpowered in the espresso and I couldn&#39;t find them at all. I did notice more of a stone fruit vibe in the espresso: most likely a plum flavour. But again this was subtle. . Overall I think I prefered this coffee as an espresso to a filter, both were great but I enjoyed the amped up mouthfeel of the espresso given the heavy flavour profile. This is a coffee that can work as both an &quot;every day&quot; drinker and a &quot;special treat&quot; when you want to savour the tastes and really dig into a flavour profile. As with pretty much every Assembly roast: another standout coffee. I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be too long before I order another batch from Assembly they&#39;re just so reliable and seem to pick coffees that just work for me. . For this weeks jazz I&#39;m picking an album from 2013. The band is the Mercury prize nominated, Mobo award winning - British jazz quartet: &quot;Sons of Kemet&quot; - with their debut album &quot;Burn&quot;. . . This album comes completely from left-field and is certainly unique. You could describe this as being part of the &quot;hipster jazz&quot; movement which I feel is a little unfair, while the sound may attract the hipster crowd it has more depth and creativity than others tarred with this brush. It should appeal to &quot;serious&quot; jazz fans too. Let&#39;s start with the personnel: . Shabaka Hutchings - Sax | Oren Marshall - Tuba | Tom Skinner - Drums | Seb Rochford - Drums | . (There is also a small electric guitar cameo on 2 of the tracks but the band itself is composed of these 4 members). . This is a truly bizarre lineup for a band, there are no &quot;harmony&quot; instruments so of course the focus will be on melodic and rhythmic ideas opposed to harmonic ones. The tuba takes the role of &quot;bass&quot; which is kind of an interesting sound in itself as it is not something you see often, especially in small band. Then of course the dual drums, reading this you may think that the drumming duties are split with Tom appearing on some tracks and Seb on others - but you would be wrong: the Sons of Kemet sound depends on 2 drummers working together. . The band leader is Shabaka Hutchings. He leads a number of other projects and has also frequently appeared as a sideman. Shabaka does not just follow the &quot;traditional&quot; jazz sound and takes great influence from electronic and hip-hop styles. His projects often feel just as home in a nightclub as they do a jazz club. &quot;Sons of Kemet&quot; is no exception. &quot;Burn&quot; has two main modes: the first I would describe as &quot;post-apocolyptic rave music&quot; and the second as &quot;spiritual contemplation&quot;. . The track &quot;Inner Babylon&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog post) is an example of the &quot;post-apocolyptic rave&quot; sound. To me it always brings images of a party in a burnt out city. I had the fortune of seeing this band play live numerous times after this album was released and there was certainly a party atmosphere - it was a unique experience for a jazz gig. I remember one in particular at the Barbican concert hall where they were supporting &quot;Mehliana&quot; (the Brad Mehldau - Mark Guiliana fusion collaboration project). &quot;Sons of Kemet&quot; totally blew the crowd away, to the point that &quot;Mehliana&quot; seemed totally tame and a bit boring, I remember the crowd even heckling Brad a few times during the show... Moral of the story: pick your support acts carefully and make sure they don&#39;t show you up! Another track I am particularly fond of on the album is &quot;The Godfather&quot;. There is a Hasidic influenceon the melodies that I find intriguing juxtaposed against the trance rhythm section. I&#39;ve always found the Hasidic musical traditions to be interesting and something I have to dig into further. . We don&#39;t often talk about record engineering or production on this blog much, owing to a complete lack of knowledge on part of the author, but it is worth mentioning here. With a small band like this with a rather limited musical range it is easy for a record to sound &quot;small&quot;. This is not the case here, the album has an absolutely huge sound! If you&#39;re not paying attention you easily forget there are only 4 musicians playing. This is not through the use of overdubs or multi-tracking, near enough the entire album is free of this and is recorded &quot;live&quot;. Instead there is the rather ingenious use of tape echo and reverb to give the illusion of a larger soundscape. This is not done in a cynical way that sounds artifical however, you don&#39;t really notice it is there. Production duties for this album fell to Seb Rochford - one of the drummers in the band and he should be commended for the work he did here. Without this I don&#39;t think the album would have half the impact it does. (Unfortunately the youtube compression does this no favours, I&#39;d recommend getting the album from alternate sources for the best experience, it is worth it!) . Seb is one of my favourite &quot;modern&quot; jazz drummers, everything he touches seems to be made better by his presence. In the jazz world you may have heard him through his band &quot;Polar Bear&quot; (another Mercury prize nominee) or playing with &quot;Acoustic Ladyland&quot;, &quot;Basquiat Strings&quot; or &quot;Andy Shepherd&quot;. He typically takes a wide range of influences from rock, electronic and world music in his jazz playing which elevates the music. However he also does session work for rock/pop acts and appeared on some of the early &quot;Babyshambles&quot; records/gigs with Pete Doherty. I&#39;ve met Seb a couple of times at gigs and he is also a really nice guy. . On the tuba side we have Oren Marshall, before &quot;Sons of Kemet&quot; I knew of him but hadn&#39;t really listened to much of him. On this album he made such an impression I looked at more of his stuff, he has a very interesting sound. If you see him perfom live you may also see him play a custom made &quot;Orenophone&quot; a modified tuba of his own design: . . Following the release of this album Seb and Oren subsequently left the band, personally I feel a lot of the magic went with them and to be honest I&#39;ve not really enjoyed their subsequent releases. But this does not take away from &quot;Burn&quot;. . To finish I&#39;ll share one more tune off the album: a cover of Boney-M: &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot;. It is unlikely you&#39;ve ever heard this track covered in this way. While Boney-M&#39;s version is rather cheesy and dated by todays standards; this version is full of spirituality and contemplation. I feel this forms a deeper connection with the intended meaning behind the song. It is a really fantastic track and a nice contrast to some of the more energetic cuts on the album. .",

            "title": "A Go Go and Assembly Monteverde",
            "content": "This week we are sticking with Assembly coffee roasters in Brixton, London. This time we move away from Africa through to South America and Colombia to be exact. The coffee is called &quot;Monteverde&quot; which is the name of the farm located in the Andean region in the Tolima department - in the centre west of the county and just west of Bogota. . As regular readers will know, Assembly decorate each coffee with a &quot;swirl&quot; which somewhat reflects the flavour profile of the coffee for this coffee we have: . . Perhaps the most &quot;interesting&quot; part of this coffee is its processing method, described by Assembly as &quot;anaerobic&quot;. The coffee undergoes a 2 stage fermentation anaerobic fermentation process where the temperature is carefully controlled between 19 and 23 celcius. The second stage is a 48 hour aerobic temperature and pH controlled fermentation. Reported to be a similar technique to Yemeni producers. I have seen these sorts of process also called &quot;semi-anaerobic&quot; and other names. This is what I would consider an &quot;experimental&quot; processing method compared to the more typical washed/natural/honey type processes we are more accustomed to. Personally I find these methods hit and miss, some of them can be great and produce interesting and complex cups but many leave me feeling cold, I find them a bit &quot;hollow&quot; (for lack of a better word) in an almost &quot;decaf&quot; sort of way. They can be intense flavour wise but unbalanced and for me not that enjoyable. As such I don&#39;t hunt out these sort of coffees. . In terms of varietal this coffee is a Caturra. This varietal is very prevelant around the Americas and represents a natural mutation of the Bourbon varietal. It is known for fairly good cup quality and yield but is considered susceptible to both leaf rust and pests. It is also a parent varietal to many hybrid or mutated varietals such as Catimor (cross with a Timor), Castillo, and others which typically offer better resistance to leaf rust and pests. . Moving onto the coffee itself. The first thing I notice is the beans have a slighlty &quot;oily&quot; look to them - not in an &quot;italian roast&quot; sort of way (these beans are definitely a light roast). It is slighlty strange and not something I really see in the sort of beans I buy, I wonder if it&#39;s a result of the particular processing? As a dry aroma we are treated to tropical fruits galore with this one - its a fruit salad in coffee form. Papaya, pineapple, mango, passion fruit - everything is there and it is a very intense experience. I found these beans a little odd as a grinding experience too, in my hand grinder for filter they almost had a &quot;spongy&quot; character. In the past I have experimented with microwaving beans prior to grinding and they have a similar texture. Very strange indeed. . As a filter the tropical fruits really carry though and it is just a fruit bomb. There is no other way to describe this coffee, big, punchy, bright but funky too. The acidity is fairly high in this one but there is a lot of sweetness too which acts to offset this. It also has a reasonably big mouthfeel and is almost syrupy. This is a very complex cup and one could spend a while trying to unpick everything in the cup. I did find it had a pretty &quot;linear&quot; heat profile though, in as much as the flavours do not evolve as the cup cools (at least very much). It does not have the &quot;hollow&quot; quality I sometimes associate with the experimental processing methods which is definitely a positive. Overall it is not the cleanest cup I&#39;ve ever had but for a cup with funk it is fairly clean. . Moving onto the espresso. The weird grinding continued for me here, I found this one a strange coffee to work with. I found you wouldn&#39;t get many fines at all until you hit a specific grind setting and then it produced an absolute boat ton of fines. This led to me adopting a very strange recipe for this coffee: 16.5g in to 50g out with the shot pulling in 14s. By most standards this would be considered a &quot;gusher&quot; and a failed shot, if I saw a cafe pulling a shot like this I would likely walk away thinking they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. But for me this just works with this coffee, going to a more &quot;traditional&quot; shot profile led to a slight acrid aftertaste note that I did not care for. One might expect a shot pulled like this to be extremely sour but this was not the case and the sweetness meant it was fairly balanced. At around a 1:3 ratio one might expect to have a very watery thin mouthfeel too, again not the case and it was quite thick and luxurious with a thick crema too. The flavour profile is similar to the filter: an absolute fruit bomb with a hint of funk. A very interesting and delcious shot of espresso. . This weeks jazz comes courtesy of John Scofield, in the form of his 1998 album &quot;A Go Go&quot;: . . This album marks his first collaboration with Medeski, Martin and Wood (MMW) with whom he has recorded 4 albums - after this album they decided to record under the name: &quot;Medeski, Scofield, Martin and Wood&quot; (MSMW). The full album musician/instrument line-up is: . John Scofield – electric &amp; acoustic guitars, whistle | John Medeski – organ, Wurlitzer, clavinet, piano | Chris Wood – acoustic &amp; electric basses | Billy Martin – drums, tambourine | . Up to this point MMW had achieved a modest cult following but it wasn&#39;t until this album that they really made it &quot;big&quot;, following on from this they released a string of fairly commercially successful records (without Scofield) mostly in the &quot;jazz-funk&quot; space. They created their own &quot;scene&quot; and attracted new listeners to jazz. However in addition to their jazz-funk side they also had their feet firmly planted in the avant-garde working with John Zorn and were also heavily linked to the &quot;jam-band&quot; scene and a certain contingent of their fans would readily describe themselves as &quot;dead heads&quot; or &quot;phish phans&quot;. In addition to recording as a trio each member has numerous side projects and collaborations in genres from more straight ahead jazz, through pop, rock and hip-hop. . The title artist, and sole composer, on the album is John Scofield - Sco to his friends. John needs no introduction really, since the 1970s he has toured and recorded with many of the titans of jazz: Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Joe Henderson, Dave Liebman, Billy Cobham, Chet Baker, Paul Bley and many many more. In addition he has had a prolific career as a leader/solo artist with around 50 records to his name. If you were to ask people to list &quot;jazz guitarists&quot; it wouldn&#39;t be a long wait to hear Sco mentioned. &quot;A Go Go&quot; is likely to have a lot to do with this as commercially it is likely to be Sco&#39;s most successful release. . In the 1970s Sco was one of the first jazz players to use a distorted &quot;rock&quot; guitar sound, before this jazz guitarists had typically used large hollowbody guitars prone to feedback into clean guitar amps. As fusion came in this changed and many opted for a distorted sound - in this respect Sco was very influencial. You can argue over who the first was to do this but for me the &quot;Scofield tone&quot; is something that many tried to imitate (I find the secret being to pick very hard right next to the bridge to get his squealing cat sort of phrasing). His playing style however cannot be imitated. His style changed over the years but has always been distinctly Sco. Initially he played faster lines, but by &quot;A Go Go&quot; he slowed down significantly. His playing is all about &quot;laziness&quot; and being as far behind the beat as possible while still being in good time. The lines themselves tend to be fairly outside but the phrasing and timing presents them in a way that you sometimes don&#39;t notice. It is something that is very hard to do, I&#39;ve heard many players do &quot;Scofield impressions&quot; but very few (if any) actually nail what he&#39;s doing. I once heard him described as: &quot;He knows so much music it just falls out of him&quot; - which I feel is an apt description for his playing style. . On to the album itself: the album has a very strong &quot;jam-band&quot; feel from the MMW supporting cast, with more than a hint of jazz-funk throughout. As with many MMW projects the music has a &quot;get up and dance&quot; feel, even when the music itself can be fairly complex and at times intense and gnarly. Mostly though it just feels like four friends playing music together and we are just fortunate there was a tape there to capture the moment. The album kicks off with the title track &quot;A Go Go&quot; (embedded above). This track is a good signpost of what is to come on the album. It has a sort of mysterious and eerie vibe, but at the same time funky and jovial. The solos are a contrast to this where both Johns play with an attitude and swagger. There are also hints of &quot;The Meters&quot; in certain parts - an influence that seems to crop up on many tracks on the album. The fifth track on the album &quot;Jeep on 35&quot; is perhaps the most sophisticated tune on the album. I guess you&#39;d describe it a having a &quot;fusion&quot; sound from the 1970s but that would be doing the tune a disservice. Although a &quot;jam-band&quot; feel there are many different parts and sections in the composition. Given the title and easy laid-back vibe this seems a tailor made soundtrack for a summer road trip. Sco&#39;s solo on this piece in particular is a perfect case study in his &quot;behind the beat&quot; or &quot;lazy&quot; soloing style that is so hard to imitate. . Another high point on the album for me is &quot;Green Tea&quot;: Here the tempo is brought right down from some of the higher energy funk that surround it on the album. All the music featured walks the narrow line between extremely &quot;relaxed&quot; music and extremely &quot;sophisticated&quot; - something that is very hard to do well. One of the real selling points of this album is just how strong every track is. If I were to re-write this entire post again I could choose any of the other tune to write about. . So if you want some funky coffee then hunt down a bag of Monteverde, if you want some funky jazz hunt down a copy of &quot;A Go Go&quot;. .",

            "content": "This week we&#39;re going to keep the blog post tight since I have been pretty busy and haven&#39;t had a lot of time to plan what I&#39;m going to write. We are heading back to our friends at Assembly Coffee Roasters located in Brixton London. The coffee in question is called Shyira and is a red-bourbon varietal from Rwanda. Shyira is the name of the mill where the coffee is processed, it is located in the Nyabihu region of the country which shares a border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to the north. . Earlier this year (May 7th 2020) Shyira and surrounding areas were subject to rather catastrophic landslides. As a result Assembly have very kindly decided to donate all profits from the sale of this coffee to the relief fund: https://www.gofundme.com/f/Rwandan-landslide - if you would like to help feel free to donate to the page or buy a bag of the coffee at: https://assemblycoffee.co.uk/collections/buy-coffee/products/rwanda-shyira . As regular readers will know, Assembly decorate each coffee with a &quot;swirl&quot; which somewhat reflects the flavour profile of the coffee for this coffee we have: . . Moving swiftly on to the coffee itself: the dry aroma gives hints of caramel and a slight spice but the over-arching quality is vibrant and zingy with plenty of citrus fruits. From the moment you open the bag you know it&#39;s going to be in for a lot of bright acidity here. As is customary in this blog we start with a filter coffee: the flavour notes on the bag are &quot;pink grapefruit&quot;, &quot;lemonade&quot; and &quot;vibrant&quot; - and I certainly couldn&#39;t think of a better description than that, for me that is right on the money. The grapefruit is very much in your face from the getgo, the lemonade appears as a sweetness to balance but there is also an almost carbonated vibe to the coffee (not in as much as it&#39;s actually fizzy, but as a flavour as you get with carbonated water/drinks). Although acidity is the focus it is not over-bearing and is not like drinking vinegar at all, it is very well balanced. This is a truly expertly roasted coffee. In terms of mouthfeel and body it is relatively thin but not devoid of any body. The aftertaste is clean and fairly shortlived. Overall extremely enjoyable as a filter, one I very sadly miss now the bag is finished. . One might assume with a light roast filter coffee that is very acidity focussed this would be an absolute nightmare to dial in as an espresso, I did not find this to be the case at all. It is surprisingly forgiving and I didn&#39;t have a single shot that was less than &quot;very good&quot; even when dialing in. I ultimately settled for a fairly &quot;traditional&quot; recipe of around a 2.2:1 ratio in about 27s. Usually a pull quite a bit longer than this for a lighter filter roast but with this one it could hold together at a shorter ratio and it didn&#39;t get too overbearing. It does like higher temperatures though and I was close to maxing out my machines temperature to get this shot. The flavour notes in the espresso are very much like in the filter, the grapefruit is the main quality and the lemonade is a little more subdued. The caramel, brown sugar sort of note that was picked up in the dry aroma rears its head in the espresso too, balancing the more wild grapefruit flavours. Being a relatively short shot we do get some body, but it&#39;s more silky than heavy. As before the aftertaste is relatively shortlived but is very clean and crisp. Just as with the filter this was very enjoyable and will be missed. . Even without the donation to the landslide appeal I would say this coffee is worth tasting, given you can do some good and enjoy a great coffee I&#39;d suggest buying a bag of this is a no-brainer. . To pair with this great coffee we are going to have Cornbread. Not the southern US delicacy (although I&#39;m sure it would go fantastically well with the coffee) but the 1967 Blue Note classic recorded by Lee Morgan. . . Lee Morgan has featured on the blog before but never as a leader. He was, and still is, one of the heavyweights of the jazz world. Many considered him to be the next &quot;flag bearer&quot; of the genre before his life was cut tragically short. Netflix (in the UK at least) currently has a brilliant documentary from 2016 called: &quot;I Called Him Morgan&quot; available, if you do not know the Lee Morgan story I strongly suggest you add it to your list of things to watch. It features interviews from some big names (most notably Wayne Shorter). Be warned it is quite a sad and tragic story, so don&#39;t go in expecting lemon drops and rainbows. . . Lee&#39;s trumpet sound for me was always clean, clear and powerful and he always played with authority. This didn&#39;t go unnoticed and he joined Dizzy Gillespie&#39;s big band and just 18 years old. Shortly afterwards appearing on &quot;Blue Train&quot; by John Coltrane and later went on to be an integral member of Art Blakey&#39;s Jazz Messengers. Progressing from being &quot;just&quot; a sideman Morgan moved on to release records under his own name as a leader, some are rightly regarded as all time classics and feature heavily in &quot;best selling&quot; album lists. . The personnel on Cornbread is: . Lee Morgan – Trumpet | Herbie Hancock – Piano | Billy Higgins – Drums | Jackie McLean – Alto sax | Hank Mobley – Tenor sax | Larry Ridley – Bass | . As with many albums on this blog any one of these artists can (and in most cases have) released successful albums under their own name. Herbie of course needs no introduction and we saw Mobley in action a few posts back - he and Lee had a particularly prolific period of collaboration and have appeared on many albums together. They seem particularly well suited to each other as musicians and seem to have a near perfect sense of what the other is trying to achieve. Jackie McLean is probably a name you&#39;d more likely associate with the avant-garde/free side of jazz (or perhaps &quot;fusion&quot;) - but on Cornbread we are all about the hard-bop and soul-jazz and he fits perfectly in this group also. . The album kicks off with the title track (embedded at the start of this post). Within a matter of seconds it is clear that this album will be something special, you can hear the slight nervous energy and tension primed and waiting to be released. You can hear the obvious influence of Herbie in the arrangement - you feel as though this could easily feature on &quot;Takin Off&quot; or any of his other early works. There is a certain amount of Mobley in the DNA of the track too - but of course it is all about Lee Morgan. Lee takes the first solo on the track and throws it down, a lot of swagger and almost arrogance to what he&#39;s playing. As a listener it puts you completely at ease as you feel you&#39;re in safe hands. While it&#39;s not particularly &quot;outside&quot; in its approach that does not equate to &quot;harmonically boring&quot; and there&#39;s a lot to get excited about. Another album highlight (for me) is the 3rd track &quot;Ceora&quot; - a beautiful ballad. I find ballads to be a real test for jazz artists, many fall down the trap of overplaying and throwing their ego at a tune. Others end up playing too &quot;inside&quot; and it just ends up a snooze-fest. Not here however, not only is the tune itself brilliantly written the solos are simply sublime. Lee in particular absolutely kills it with his solo; daring, interesting yet still simple and beautiful. Ballads are possibly not the first thing you think of when you here the &quot;Lee Morgan&quot; name but he is simply fantastic on this one. Herbie too takes a superb slow burning solo with real passion. . Perhaps the greatest thing about this album is the sheer consistency. From start to finish every single track is fantastic and worthy of note. From the slightly sombre standard &quot;Ill Wind&quot; (the only track not composed by Morgan on the album) or the hard-bop soul-jazz swinging groove of &quot;Most Like Lee&quot;. . The second track on the album is &quot;Our Man Higgins&quot; - penned as a reflection on drummer Billy Higgins (a legend in his own right). It is perhaps the most interesting of the tunes on this album, it relies heavily on chromaticism and is essentially a bridge between the &quot;free&quot; sound and the hard-bop sound. Higgins himself and of course McLean are well versed in the free side whereas Morgan and Mobley are more associated with the hard-bop side. This makes for some interesting tension throughout the piece as it sways between the styles depending on the soloist. . We have covered a lot of Blue Note records on this blog so far, and for good reason - they are on the whole fantastic. But one piece of the puzzle we have overlooked so far is Rudy Van Gelder the sound engineer. I bring this up in this post because Cornbread is such a fantastic sounding album, it has the quintessential &quot;hard-bop&quot; sound which helps raise the music that much more. . If there were such a thing as a list of &quot;essential&quot; jazz albums this is certainly one I would feature. If you are looking for some jazz to listen to you can do much worse than give this one 40 minutes of your time. .",

            "title": "Elder Don and Round Hill Mbirizi",
            "content": "This week we are sticking with the Round Hill Roastery with a filter roast from Burundi - an origin that has featured on the blog a few times in the past. This particular example is a washed Bourbon varietal, the coffee takes its name after the washing station where it was processed: Mbirizi. It is located in the north of the country close to the border with Rwanda. As far as I can tell this one has an SCA score of 87 and so we expect some quality in this cup! . As in the previous post this coffee arrived in brown paper packaging instead of the usual baby blue you would expect from a Round Hill filter roast. As I stated I was never much of a fan of the blue/pink packaging so this was a welcome change. Yesterday however Round Hill announced a new packaging style (in the usual blue/pink colourways) - and I have to say I like it much more: . . This gives the coffee a more modern and clean look which I really like. I&#39;m a firm believer that packaging matters a lot with coffees, the moment you get the bag in your hand you subconciously begin to develop expectations. If the bag is not aesthetically pleasing or looks &quot;amateur&quot; it is hard to get rid of this when it comes round to tasting the coffee itself. So I am very happy to see this new packaging and will look forward to my next Round Hill order to see how it looks &quot;in the flesh&quot;. . In a similar way I also believe that the drinking vessel you use makes a big difference to how you perceive your coffee. I have tried a wide variety of cups for filter and demitasse for espresso and for me a few things seem to make a real difference. Firstly for filter I prefer a &quot;cup&quot; style with no handle as opposed to a mug, the hand warming sensation of grabbing a cup adds to the overall experience and feels more interactive. Secondly in terms of shape I tend to gravitate towards taller, thinner cups instead of shorter, squatter cups. The thin and tall nature of the cup means you have to tilt your head back slightly further to take a sip and so the aromatics can flow into the nostrils better, the sharper radius of the cup also means the coffee does not fill the mouth quite as much with each sip - you sacrifice a &quot;big mouthfeel&quot; but I find it easier to pick out more delicate acidic notes which are the ones I gravitate towards. I also like a thinner rim to drink from as an experience - this also helps the coffee cool quicker since there&#39;s less thermal mass. In terms of demitasse I go for much the same qualities really, although it is hard to find many thinner rim espresso cups since most want to keep the beverage hot for longer. Personally I&#39;d rather the sensation of drinking from the thin rim in the knowledge I have to drink it quicker (since it&#39;s an espresso how long will it stick around anyway?) I also find sizing an issue with demitasse, many are larger than I would like since (I assume) they are designed in a way that allows you to make a macchiato/cortardo/etc. but I never bother with those. There is something upsetting about seeing an espresso barely make its way halfway up a cup! In terms of material I do not enjoy glass very much, although it is great to see the definition of the crema or clarity of the filter in them, so am usually looking for ceramic/porcelain. The &quot;earthenware&quot; style cups are nice to hold but again I do not like the drinking experience quite as much. And of course a paper takeaway cup is about the worst experience one can have, even without thinking about the environmental implication. But this is all personal preference so I&#39;d suggest just trying a few different things and seeing what works for you and sometimes you may have recieved a cup as a gift and so you associate it with a loved one, in which case none of the &quot;technical&quot; stuff matters! . Moving onto the coffee itself: as usual starting with the filter. This coffee is one of the most sensitive to temperature I think I&#39;ve ever seen. First cup I made I took the first sip while it was still quite hot and thought I had made a big mistake. There was no flavour definition and it was just kind of muddled. However letting it cool down a few degrees and it really comes alive. The cup is fairly complex, there are orange and grapefruit citrus flavours there, I notice raspberries too and an almost red-wine like vibe to the whole thing. In the aftertaste I&#39;m left with a tea-like floral quality that is very clean. Very nice and super interesting yet surprisingly easy to drink too. Unfortunately I find if it cools too much it starts to deteriorate and lose balance, so there&#39;s a relatively narrow temperature window for this coffee for me. I guess this would be a perfect coffee to use with a temperature controlled ember mug! As an espresso this coffee is an interesting one, based on the filter I was convinced I needed to use my &quot;typical&quot; filter roast espresso style, quick hot long pulls, but this wasn&#39;t right. By no means unpleasant but it seemed to lack a bit of punch. I dialed back to something closer to a &quot;traditional&quot; recipe and it really came alive. The red wine-y thing really jumped out at first, the citrus flavours were a little muted but that same aftertaste that I liked in the filter was still there - in fact it was a more intense aftertaste in the espresso which was certainly welcomed. Overall I enjoyed this one a lot and it is certainly quirky, I imagine with more time to play around I could uncover some more interesting things about this coffee. . Moving swiftly onto this weeks jazz. This week has been a busy one in JazzCoffeeStuff HQ and so I&#39;ve been craving simplicity in the music I&#39;ve been listening to. One place I like to go for simplicity is the Blue Note &quot;Soul Jazz&quot; movement of the 1960s (which we have visited before with Lou Donaldson). In digging through the archives I re-discovered an oft-overlooked artist: Don Wilkerson. After much deliberation I decided to settle on the album &quot;Elder Don&quot; (but don&#39;t ask me tomorrow or I&#39;ll pick a different one from his trio of Blue Note recordings). . . Don Wilkerson is not really a &quot;name&quot; in jazz, I would go as far as to say even some hardened jazz fans might not even recognise the name. He has very limited recorded output, he has 3 records on Blue Note (&quot;Elder Don&quot;, &quot;Preach Brother&quot; and &quot;Shoutin&#39;&quot;) and an earlier record on Riverside (&quot;Texas Twister&quot;). However it is highly likely you will have heard him play: he recorded sax solos on some of Ray Charles biggest hits such as &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot;. He is known for a powerful and confident tenor sound. This is about the limits of my knowledge about him, as I say he&#39;s very underappreciated. . The line up on &quot;Elder Don&quot; is: . Don Wilkerson - tenor saxophone | John Acea - piano | Grant Green - guitar | Lloyd Trotman - bass | Willie Bobo - drums | . Who apart from Green (and maybe Bobo) are not what you would call &quot;big names&quot; in jazz. In fact I would struggle to name any other recrdings featuring Acea or Trotman at all. This doesn&#39;t matter however since on this album they are great. . Embedded above is the 3rd track, closing side A of the record called &quot;Scrappy&quot;, it is probably the most &quot;hard bop&quot; this record gets. The main melody comprising of a cool doubled line between Wilkerson and Green. The Wilkerson powerful tenor sound is there throughout his solo which is relatively simple melodically and harmonically but packs a punch. This is followed by a typical Grant Green masterclass in jazzy-blues. As a guitarist myself I&#39;ve always respected the laid-back approch Green has, it&#39;s very easy for a guitarist to get &quot;too excited&quot; and throw too many notes around but Green never does this. I&#39;m also a big fan of his guitar tone, many jazz guitarists have pretty questionable tone in my experience but Green&#39;s is always great - punchy and throaty sounding. I&#39;m not sure but it sounds like he&#39;s using his Gibson 330 on this record. . Despite &quot;just&quot; being a soul-jazz record &quot;Elder Don&quot; actually covers a lot of ground. The opening track &quot;Señorita Eula&quot;, as the name suggests takes a latin influence to the soul-jazz or hard-bop sound. The main left hand riff of Acea also has a strong Professor Longhair influence to it. The record thus starts with a celebratory party atmosphere. The latin influence moves to Cuba in the 2nd track &quot;San Antonio Rose&quot; - these two tunes leaning into the Willie Bobo wheelhouse which gives a feeling of authenticity. The final track on the album &quot;Poor Butterfly&quot; is a soft slow ballad, very different from the preceeding tracks and gives the album some depth. My choice pick on the album however is &quot;Lone Star Shuffle&quot;. As the name suggests this is a simple blues shuffle. As much as I love sophisticated jazz harmony sometimes a basic blues played with attitude is all you need. Both Wilkerson and Green are totally at home playing a shuffle, their playing will not blow you away with sophistication or complexity but it has its place. . Overall the album is probably not a &quot;must listen, all time classic&quot; that you need to own in your collection. It does serve a purpose however when you don&#39;t want to think too much or perhaps you just need something on in the background there are certainly worse records to serve that purpose. There is often a bit of jazz snobbery whereby only the most complicated, sophisticated and groundbreaking records/artists get respect - but for me there&#39;s a time and place for the less adventurous stuff too. .",

            "title": "Angel Song and Round Hill Samii Nensebo Refisa",
            "content": "This week we are heading back to another favourite roaster of this blog: Round Hill Coffee Roasters located in Bath, England. Round Hill have long been one of my dependable roasters - it&#39;s rare I have coffees anything less than &quot;good&quot; from them. I was particuarly excited for this weeks coffee since it is a washed Ethiopian which is my favourite origin/processing combination. . The coffee is called: &quot;Samii Nensebo Refisa #3&quot; and, as always, I opted for the filter roast despite using the coffee for espresso also. Refisa is the name of the washing station where the coffee has been processed. Samii is a classifier you see on many washed Ethiopian coffees, it is essentially a flavour description that denotes the coffee in question has a strong &quot;floral&quot; element to its flavour profile. Nensebo is a region located in the south-west corner of Ethiopia. This coffee scored a cupping score of 88 which is very high for a &quot;normal&quot; non-competition grade/gesha/the like (but recall from before that we shouldn&#39;t rely too heavily on cupping scores when choosing coffees). The varietals are listed as Wolisho and Krume - it is so nice to finally be able to list varietals on an Ethiopian coffee and not simply rely on the tired old &quot;heirloom varietal&quot; to describe them. Unfortunately however there is currently very little information out there (as of yet) about the qualities of the individual varietals and I have not yet had a large enough sample to really draw any conclusions about them. . Moving onto getting this coffee into my cup! The dry aroma of the beans for me is quite spicy, a warming ginger-y sort of spice. But the more typical Ethiopian florals, tea and stone fruits are there too. A good dry aroma does not always lead to a good cup but in my experience a bad dry aroma never leads to a good cup - so at least we&#39;re starting on the right track. As usual starting with my usual filter with Chemex papers: first impression is this coffee is as clean as they come. No hint of any &quot;roasty&quot; notes (that never happens with Round Hill in my experience) and there are no &quot;dirty&quot; tastes at all (sometimes a bit of dirt can be nice however). A real test of a coffee, in my opinion, is how well it holds together as it cools and this one takes you on a journey. It starts off being a bit &quot;fizzy&quot; and bright - the note on the bag is &quot;lemon sherbert&quot; which I don&#39;t fundamentally disagree with. For me it is more like a really crisp lemonade however. As the cup cools the florals come out to play and the cup gets super complex and interesting, I would say the most apt descriptor for this stage would be &quot;candied lavendar&quot; at least that is what I think of when drinking it. As it cools down a little more it turns into juicy round peaches and sweet iced tea to finish. I&#39;m not sure if it takes on another transformation as it gets even cooler it has never stuck around long enough for me to tell. As a filter it is everything you want in a washed Ethiopian. . Before talking about the espresso I&#39;m going to take a bit of a detour and talk about a very unglamorous part of espresso machine ownership: the cleaning. One of the biggest mistakes I see new home-baristas making (second only to using bad water) is not keeping the machine clean enough. It is basically impossible to &quot;clean too much&quot; and the more you keep the internals clean the more you will be rewarded in the cup and ultimately the longer the life of your machine. I am fortunate enough to own a Londinium R spring loaded lever machine which makes the cleaning ritual that much easier, back-flushing is not a thing in a lever machine (in fact you&#39;ll cause major damage if you try). Basically &quot;all&quot; I have to do is remove the screen and basket to soak in some coffee cleaner (I like Cafetto brand), raise the piston and use some of the coffee cleaner on a paper towel to scrub clean the chamber. Give everything a good scrub with a soft brush (I use an old toothbrush) and rinse everything very well and that&#39;s all that&#39;s really needed. I have to say it is my favourite part of owning this machine. I make sure I do this after every 4-6 shots pulled and between each shot I use an Espazolla group head cleaner to wash off any loose coffee grounds that may be stuck to the screen. . . If all this sounds like too much work (and there is much more to do on a &quot;normal&quot; machine) then you probably don&#39;t want to get into the home espresso game. There is nothing worse than a dirty machine and you will notice it (or you will after you clean and realise how disgusting the taste was before!) As an aside it&#39;s a good way to judge a cafe, if you&#39;re sitting in for more than 15mins or so and you haven&#39;t seen them clean the machine it&#39;s probably time to find a new cafe! In most of the best cafes you&#39;ll probably see a timer stuck next to each group counting down, this is a reminder for the baristas that it&#39;s time to clean the machine again. I know some cafes use different ways of doing this but the timer is the most common in my experience. . With a nice clean machine lets move onto putting Samii Nensebo Refisa through its paces as an espresso. I found this coffee to live a bit on a knife edge, to get a really great espresso required great care in dialing in and subsequently minor adjustments every day to keep it in tip top form. If you don&#39;t nail it you still end up with a tasty drink but it&#39;s just a bit flat flavour wise but when you nail it you&#39;re handsomely rewarded. As a filter roast, and a reasonably light one at that, my usual dial in &quot;rules&quot; applied. Keep everything hot and pull fast was the name of the day. I ended up with a 2.9:1 ratio in 21s as my preferred recipe for my setup/water. As you would expect with such a long pull there isn&#39;t a whole lot of body in the cup but I don&#39;t mind that. By giving up the body we get treated to a really complex espresso, if you enjoy picking out flavours you can have a field day. That spicy note from the dry aroma sits in the background, which is interesting since I didn&#39;t pick it up at all in the filter. It&#39;s quite hard for florals to come through in an espresso, a lot of the time they get overpowered by other more dominant flavours. Not in this case though, the florals are noticable. The major flavour note for me is that peach-tea quality, it keeps things very sweet and easy to drink since it balances the acidity nicely. It is one worth battling with for the &quot;god shots&quot; you can get out of it. I should say they also offer this as an espresso roast which I&#39;m sure is much easier to dial in for those that don&#39;t want to battle. . For our jazz this week we are looking at a 1997 album from Kenny Wheeler on the ECM record label called: &quot;Angel Song&quot;. . . Let&#39;s start by looking at the line up: . Kenny Wheeler - Trumpet, Flugelhorn | Lee Konitz - Alto Saxophone | Dave Holland - Double-Bass | Bill Frisell - Electric Guitar | . By whatever standard you care to use this is an &quot;all-star&quot; lineup. Each of these artists is worth writing a whole blog about by themselves. It is also interesting to note that this album does not feature any drums/percussion of any kind. It is all about the interaction between the musicians and allowing them to play off each other. It is a subtle album and to really find the beauty in it may take a few listens. Overall I consider it one of the gems on the ECM label. . Starting with the title artist Wheeler. He is perhaps best known as a composer/arranger and for me that is where his talents lied. Nobody could (nor can) compose like Wheeler, he is instantly recognisable. His compositions maintain an ambient, mystical quality with a kind of haunting beauty. When paired with the right musicians it can be spectacular, as on &quot;Angel Song&quot;. He also frequently played the flugelhorn which is my favourite instrument from a tonal/timbral perspective and works particularly well with his compositional voice. . Lee Konitz can only be described as a jazz legend, he had a fruitful career spanning over 70 years before he died earlier this year. He was a key contributor to &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; by Miles Davis and was a big figure in the whole &quot;cool&quot; movement. His style is very relaxed and lyrical, focussed very heavily on simple and pure melody. I was fortunate enough to see him perform a couple of years ago and he was still putting on a great show. There was a particular highlight where the band was playing &quot;Just Friends&quot; and after his solo Lee was clearly a little miffed so grabbed the guitarist (Jakob Bro) to one side and shouted at him: &quot;Why are you playing all that complicated stuff? Just play the damn tune!&quot; Which perfectly sums up the Konitz approach. . Holland essentially takes the place of the &quot;rhythm section&quot; in this band, typically playing quite simple driving bass-lines to keep things moving. For my money he is one of the best touring musicians out there to this day and I always try and get tickets if I can. His persona comes across as understated and effortless cool which comes across in the music, very confident without the need to shout about it. I was once at Ronnie Scott&#39;s waiting to be seated when Dave walked past into the club - the lady on the desk panicked having no idea who he was and ran to stop him and said: &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s a private club you&#39;re not allowed in here&quot; to which he replied: &quot;But I am the act!&quot; to much laughter in the queue. . As a guitarist, Bill Frisell is probably my biggest single influence. I find his comping style fascinating, he manages to do so much with so little. It&#39;s as if by holding back he holds up a mirror and the soloing musician ends up sounding even more like themselves. On this album this is really noticable since it is all about this interplay. Bill will never blow you away with chops or come at a tune with any ego, a lot of times you don&#39;t always notice what he is doing but if you removed his part a lot of the magic of a tune would be lost. . For reasons I don&#39;t understand this album has a pitfully low AllMusic review (2/5) - I&#39;m not sure if one of the musicians did something to the reviewer personally but it is baffling. This acts as a reminder not to focus on AllMusic ratings too much, as useful as it is as a resource. . Ordinarily in these blogs I like to embed a few tunes to talk about, unfortunately I am not able to do this here since ECM are particularly good at removing their music from youtube. But with an album like this it kind of doesn&#39;t matter, since it is such a moody, ethereal experience the album really needs to be enjoyed in 1 go. Embedded at the start of this post are the 2 opening tracks &quot;Nicolette&quot; and &quot;Present Past&quot; which should give you a good feeling of what is to come on the rest of the album (although the sound quality on youtube is particularly bad and not representive of the album itself). If you are after atmospheric, haunting beauty you could do much worse than give this one a listen. I find it a highly thought provoking and really warrants some attention to get the most out of it. Yet equally it doesn&#39;t fight for your attention so in that sense it could be used as a background soundtrack to the rest of your day. If I had to pick a single track as a favourite it would likely be the 4th: &quot;Unti&quot; which I find to be the perfect example of haunting, imperfect beauty. .",

            "content": "This week we are staying with the fine people at PLOT coffee roastingre making their 5th appearance on this blog. This time we are making our first trip to Kenya through their Gaturiri AA coffee. . There was a period around 5 years ago when Kenyan coffees were the be all and end all. As soon as (UK) summer rolled round all the top London coffee shops had some sort of washed Kenyan on offer. They were treated as the high watermark of what specialty had to offer. Personally I never went crazy for Kenyan coffees, I like them a lot as a filter but I sometimes find their acidity can get a little too much in an espresso. This was especially true a few years ago when there was a few years where London coffee shops wanted to serve exceptionally bright and sour espresso shots, thankfully this trend has largely gone away and most places are roasting more developed and balanced Kenyan roasts these days. . As most Kenyan coffees this one is a washed process, recall from our previous blogs that washed (as the name suggests) involves washing the coffee cherry away from the seed. This leads to a cleaner tasting cup, it is generally &quot;easier&quot; to process coffee this way since you do not have to monitor fermentation or worry as much about how the coffee is drying. Finding a non-washed coffee from Kenya is quite difficult and you don&#39;t see them often, however I understand that certain farms are now experimenting with alternate processing techniques and these should be landing later this year, which will certainly be interesting to try! . The varietals in this coffee are SL28 and SL34. These are common varietals in Kenyan coffee. These varietals descend from the Bourbon genetic lineage. They are recognised as having some of the highest levels of cup quality of all varietals however they are also highly suceptible to pests and disease. These varietals also crop up in other origins such as Uganda or Malawi. The varietals were first discovered in the 1930s in Kenya by Scott Labs (hence the &quot;SL&quot; prefix) who were established by the colonial British government to aid agriculture within the region. The lab worked to characterize and classify the various coffee varietals in order to find those producing superior tastes but most importantly were also resistant to droughts. The two &quot;winners&quot; were SL28 and SL34. The former is considered to (typically) have a better cup quality and is better suited to higher altitude growing, SL34 is still considered very good in the cup but is able to be grown at lower altitudes. . Another common descriptor on Kenyan coffees is the &quot;AA&quot; designation (or &quot;AB&quot; etc.) This often gets interpreted as denoting the &quot;quality&quot; of the coffee but in reality it only refers to the size of the beans themselves. If the beans are of a certain size (which they determine by passing beans through a sieve) they are labelled AA, a different size and they are labelled as AB. This doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with quality whatsoever - think about many Ethiopian &quot;heirloom&quot; type varietals which are tiny yet have great cup quality! It is a myth that does seem to stick around however, I do wonder if certain producers/roasters use this to try and charge a higher premium! Outside of Kenya you rarely see bean size designations on coffees. . As is customary in this blog lets move onto tasting the coffee in question! Starting as usual in a filter we are treated to the characteristic &quot;Kenyan&quot; taste of blackerry and blackcurrant in spades. Kenyan coffees have this characteristic flavour that so few other coffees manage, if these flavours speak to you you&#39;ll definitely want to hunt down some Kenyan coffees. In addition to the blackberry quality this particular example combines a hibiscus like floral-fruity sweetness. It is not the most acidic coffee in this style I&#39;ve ever had and it&#39;s actually very drinkable. In terms of washed Kenyan coffees I&#39;d describe this as quite a mellow one, as it cools down the more delicate floral notes come out to play. This is one that really changes as it cools, if you leave it long enough to get fairly cold (if you can wait that long) - it manages to hold itself together where often a coffee can start to taste a bit rough. At this stage a kind of orange flavour begins to come through which is kind of neat. Moving onto the espresso, sometimes I find Kenyan coffees a bit of a pain to dial in as espresso - especially those such as this one primarily designed as a filter roast. However this one was really quite forgiving - I didn&#39;t have a single &quot;sink job&quot;. My usual &quot;rules&quot; for pulling light roast espresso holds true with this one and I ended up setlling on a longer ratio of 16.5g in to 45.0g out (around 1:2.75 ratio). The is not much to speak of in terms of mouthfeel but the sweetness really comes to the front and the acidity is well balanced. The same sort of tasting notes come through as in the filter. . Moving onto the jazz of the week. This time I have selected the Blue Note 1960 album &quot;Roll Call&quot; by Hank Mobley: . . Hank Mobley is one of my all time favourite jazz artists, some of his albums on Blue Note (both as leader and sideman) are simply incredible. I feel he has been a little hard done by however. He is not the &quot;household name&quot; (or whatever the equivalent is in jazz) - and many completely overlook him and focus on the Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter&#39;s of the world. Don&#39;t get me wrong those guys are fantastic and rightly deserve their acolades but we should show some love to Hank too! If you pick up a jazz record guide, and if they have Hank listed at all, they&#39;ll just compare him to those guys and not as an artist in his own right. Even the &quot;positive&quot; reviews label him as &quot;saxophone middleweight champion&quot; (refering to the fact he is not as flashy as a Rollins/Coltrane nor and sensual as a Stan Getz) - which I have always found a bit of a derogatory description since it reads a lot like a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; type description. . Hank&#39;s style is largely in the hard-bop realm. I find his playing to be incredibly mature, he can rip and has great chops but he chooses to hold back and focus on the groove much of the time. For him the music always came first before gaining recognition or noteriety. He didn&#39;t seem interested in &quot;innovating&quot; and creating a whole new paradigm, instead he was looking to create the most perfect hard-bop sound he could. This was evident in his tone which is sublime and for my money one of the best tenor sounds in all of jazz, it is big warm and inviting. Even when playing complicated fast lines his tone remains fat, that is something very few manage to achieve. . Mobley first made a name for himself for being part of Horace Silver&#39;s Jazz Messengers (which later became Art Blakey&#39;s Jazz Messengers) - given this was probably the pre-eminent hard-bop group of the era this gives some indication to his ability! After his stint with Silver he did some work with Donald Byrd and appeared alongside other such hard-bop talent such as Wynton Kelly, Philly Joe Jones and Grant Green. However as a sideman he was probably most well known for his incredibly productive partnership with trumpet legend Lee Morgan with whom he recorded some of the most well known and commercially successful hard-bop records. . On &quot;Roll Call&quot; the personel reads: . Hank Mobley - tenor saxophone | Freddie Hubbard - trumpet | Wynton Kelly - piano | Paul Chambers - bass | Art Blakey - drums | . Which is a pretty impressive line up, if you were playing &quot;fantasy hard-bop&quot; you would struggle to create a line up that would better this! It is no surprise then that from start to finish this album is a complete triumph. It kicks off with the title track (embedded at the start of this post) - a typical driving Art Blakey drum groove kicks off preceedings, followed by a latin influenced harmony from Hubbard and Mobley before breaking into the main theme. Within about 30s of the album starting we have already been taken on a musical rollercoaster and can tell this album will just ooze quality. One of my favourite cuts on the album is &quot;The More I See You&quot; which is a Warren and Gordon standard. This is the only standard on an album otherwise comprised of Mobley originals. To me this is the &quot;definitive&quot; version of this standard, from start to finish it is perfect. One of Mobley&#39;s great talents is his ability to work with the band - every member is serving the music and not themselves. The way he plays off Kelly&#39;s piano in the main theme is particularly good on this track. It is interesting to hear Hubbard play with a muted tone also, it is not something you hear too often and conjures up images of Miles. I find Hubbard an interesting artist, I feel as a sideman he is one of the best of all time however his releases as a band leader have never blown me away. . This album is so solid it is really difficult to pick out any &quot;top tracks&quot;, while as a work it is not &quot;innovative&quot; and its intent is more &quot;evolution&quot; than &quot;revolution&quot; - it is certainly worth your time. In jazz (and coffee, and as a matter of fact life in general) we often clamour to find something new and innovative and tend to under appreciate those that &quot;simply&quot; aim to perfect what is already there. Both &quot;Roll Call&quot; and &quot;Gaturiri AA&quot; fit into this camp - we can find more boundary pushing jazz and we can find more complicated processing methods and complex flavours. But in the end we can&#39;t take anything away from them. .",

            "title": "Tuesday Wonderland and PLOT Fidel Huancas",
            "content": "This week we are heading back to a relatively new roaster for me: PLOT coffee roasters in Woolwich. Readers may remember a trio of their coffees featured on the page a couple of months ago which were heavily favoured. This is part of my second order from them. I&#39;m hesitant to judge a roaster based on a single order so we will see if this one lives up to the previous coffees from them. . Again I am very impressed with the packaging, the pink and black branded packing boxes through to the &quot;sound wave&quot; style logos on the bags it is all very well done. The packaging is something I always look at when judging a roaster/coffee, it is my opinion that you make judgements about a coffee from the instant you see it and having attractive packaging adds to this. You &quot;first drink with your eyes&quot; is the expression I believe! Further good packaging to me suggests that a roaster is leaving no stone unturned, they are concerned with how their coffee is perceived at every step of the coffee drinking journey - I think this is a good indicator of attention to detail and passion, both of which are crucially important to find in a roaster. . The coffee today is called: &quot;Fidel Huancas - Chirinos Competition Lot&quot; - which is a bit of a mouthful. Fidel Huancas is the man behind the coffee, the producer who is responsible for ensuring the quality of the on site processing, growing, etc. Chirinos is the district of the province San Ignacio where the farm is located. This is in the north west corner of the country, not too far from the border with Ecuador. The term &quot;competition lot&quot; has sprung up more and more in recent years, it does not seem to be a protected term but is meant to be an indicator that the coffee is of a quality that it could be used in barita or brewing competitions. . A piece of information you often find on the label of a coffee or on the roasters website is &quot;altitude&quot; or &quot;elevation&quot; - this is measured in meters above sea level (MASL) and as one would expect represents how &quot;high&quot; the coffee bushes are grown. When I was first getting into specialty coffee many many moons ago people were obsessing over altitude, people often judging whether to buy a coffee based on this metric alone. These days it appears as though the metric is not given the weight it once was, which in my opinion is a good thing. Generally speaking a coffee at a higher altitude will be favoured as being sweeter and more complex, and so some aim for higher altitude coffees as a result. Unfortunately it is not quite that simple. Higher does not necessarily mean better, what really matters (or so it seems) is the speed at which the coffee plants grow which is related to temperature. At a higher altitude generally the temperature will be lower which means the plants will grow more slowly and develop the complex flavours and sugars we are after. However we can equally find lower altitude locations that have lower temperatures and slower growing cherries which are equally delicious! . Unfortunately temperature is not something that is easy to quantify, each day the temperature will fluctuate and over the course of a growing season there may be large swings. Even the &quot;average temperature&quot; nor the temperature range tell us very much at all. As such altitude has become the proxy metric used. Personally I never look at altitude at all when deciding on whether to buy or try a coffee, I have not found it a particularly useful indicator for any particular characteristic or quality. Everybody is different though, so if you find that there is a strong correlation between coffees you enjoy and the altitude they&#39;re grown at stick with it! . Moving onto the tasting of this coffee. The first thing that strikes me with this coffee is the dry aroma of the beans (both whole and ground) - the smell is very intense. I&#39;d describe it as a dried fruit sweet sort of smell laced with a delicate floral note. I usually find that the very best tasting coffees have a very intense dry aroma, it is not universally true and a great dry aroma does not always translate to a good cup but this coffee is onto a good start! As usual starting with my usual filter set up. The first thing I get hit with is apricot, this coffee has it in spades! Those that know me know that, while I&#39;m not big on desserts, an apricot tart is one of my favourite things. This coffee reminds me a bit of that. If apricot is the head note of the coffee the heart is sweet caramel which gives some body to the coffee, perhaps apricot compote is a good descriptor given this syrupy body. As the coffee cools floral notes begin to appear and these linger in the aftertaste which is long lived and clean. Moving onto the espresso the flavour profile is much the same. I found that this coffee likes to be pulled long, about a 2.7:1 works for me. Too short and the flavours get a bit muddled and it&#39;s hard to discern individual notes. As a longer pull the flavours are defined and totally delicious! At this level the syrupy mouthfeel has all but gone but I feel this is a fair compromise. Pulling out floral notes in an espresso can be difficult, they are often dominated by the &quot;heavier&quot; notes but they manage to punch through in the aftertaste here. . This is another stand out coffee for me from the folks at PLOT. If this one is not in my shortlist for &quot;coffees of the year&quot; I have some outstanding coffees to look forward to in the last 6 months of the year! . This week&#39;s jazz is the 2006 seminal album &quot;Tuesday Wonderland&quot; by Esbjörn Svennson Trio (EST) on the ACT record label: . . I remember the lead up to this album being released very vividly, at the time I was a regular reader of Jazzwise magazine and it felt like every issue for the year leading up to the release (and subsequently) had an article about this album. By this point EST were already big names in the jazz world. In the late 1990s to early 2000s jazz was in a bit of a lull, by this point the whole &quot;fusion&quot; thing had lost its way and there was a movement back towards more &quot;traditional&quot; styles, however what was lacking was a young act who won international acclaim, this is where EST came in. They almost singlehandedly kept jazz alive during this period and spawned many imitators who are still playing with the &quot;EST sound&quot; today. Unusually for an album surrounded in such hype and expectation &quot;Tuesday Wonderland&quot; not only lived up to it but possibly exceeded it, which is not something you can say often. . The EST style is hard to put down in words but unmistakable once you hear it. There is a clear influence of modern European classical composers (they list Bartok in particular as an influence regularly). Esbjörn&#39;s piano style also takes inspiration from Keith Jarrett to my ear. While each member plays (primarily) on acoustic instruments they layer these with multi-track recording and run electronic effects to keep things fresh. Magnus Öström is on drum duty for the band and plays with both manic urgency as well as tender subtlty, feeling most at home playing drum and bass and techno grooves. Dan Berglund on bass brings with him the thunderous weight through the rock and heavy metal influence to preceedings. EST represents &quot;fusion&quot; in its truest sense being a melting pot of ideas. In doing this they managed to create a sound all to themselves that is not like anything that came before it. . One of my favourite pieces from the entire EST back catalogue is &quot;The Goldhearted Miner&quot; (embedded above). It is a beautiful subtle piece with a very strong melody. It is the sort of tune I could imagine being a standard if it had been released some 60 years earlier. It does not have quite the &quot;broad influence&quot; that some of the other pieces on the album have however. Perhaps their biggest hit is &quot;Goldwrap&quot;: This even had a &quot;proper&quot; music video associated with it! Back in 2006 this was essentially unheard of, I can&#39;t think of another record from the era that had that sort of reach. It shows how big the band had become, I seem to remember even seeing this appear on the music TV channels on satelite television at the time. Compared to &quot;The Goldhearted Miner&quot; this one features more prominently some of the electronic effects on the instruments and some of the EST-isms that made the band so popular. . Live the band were also a force to be reckoned with. They managed to attract a young &quot;hip&quot; crowd that comprised of jazz fans, electronic music fans and rock fans alike. The crowd hanging on every single the note, and the band acting like a conductor whipping the audience up into a frenzy. There was also a running &quot;bit&quot; that Esbjörn did; the band would play 3 or 4 tunes on the bounce and then Esbjörn would try to announce what was just played to the crowd but &quot;forgot&quot; the names and the more eager members of the audience would shout out to remind him. I&#39;m not sure if it was a genuine slip of the mind from being so deep into the moment or whether it was just a shtick, either way it certainly added a little humour to the gigs. . Unfortunately Esbjörn died tragically young, at just the age of 44, in a freak scuba diving accident in 2008 only 2 years after the release of &quot;Tuesday Wonderland&quot;. This was a devestating event in recent jazz history and he will be sorely missed. I was forunate enough to catch, what turned out to be, one of the last UK shows. It was truly fantastic and a totally memorable experience. Afterwards I even got to meet the band as they hung around for autographs and the like. Unfortunately camera phones of the day were still fairly rudimentary (at least the one I had) so I do not have a high-def picture but you can see me as a fresh-faced wee nipper below: . . To end this post I&#39;ll leave one of the more experimental cuts from the album called: &quot;Brewery of Beggars&quot;. I feel this really captures the &quot;melting pot&quot; ethos of the band and highlights the use of electronic effects and rockier sounds the band were known for. .",

            "title": "The Grand Wazoo and Assembly Bumbogo",
            "content": "This week we are sticking with the London based Assembly coffee roasters. We are drinking a washed Rwandan coffee by the name Bumbogo. Those who have read previous blog posts here will know about the Assembly &quot;paint swirls&quot; for this coffee the swirl can be seen below: . . As with many Rwandans this coffee is a bourbon varietal, which we have talked about in the blog in the past. Rwanda is a fairly small country that shares many land borders. This particular coffee is grown in the Gakenke region which is in the north of the country and is close to the borders with Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For such a small country Rwanda produces lots of great coffees with a reasonable amount of variation. I would say the &quot;classic&quot; Rwandan style of coffee has high acidity and sweetness typically with lots of red berry type tasting notes. . Washed African coffees roasted for filter (such as this one) can be notoriously finnicky to dial in for espresso, many do not even bother trying and stick to more developed darker roasts which are more forgiving and do not have quite as much acidity. Personally this is my favourite style of espresso and so I will talk about some things that I do to make these roasts work for me. . Starting off with the water: even as espresso a large amount of what you&#39;re drinking is water. A water that tastes good on its own does not necessarily translate to good coffee (but a bad tasting water certainly will translate to bad coffee!) A lot has been written about water for coffee and the widely held consensus is there are 2 components of the water that matter: the &quot;general hardness&quot; ions (calcium and magnesium) and &quot;buffer&quot; (carbonates and bicarbonates). Without getting too deep into the science at a very high level the &quot;general hardness&quot; carries the flavour and the &quot;buffer&quot; acts to reduce the acidity. One might think then that a large amount of calcium/magnesium in the water is a good thing as it will enhance the flavour, but this is generally not the case - too little and the coffee is hollow tasting, too much and it tastes muddy and lacking clarity. There is a sweet spot. The same with bicarbonate, too little and the acidity can be harsh and too much and the coffee tastes dull. . With a bright acidic style of coffee one might assume that we would want a higher buffer content to try and &quot;tame&quot; the acidity. In my experience this is not true, I find for the lighter roasts you want a &quot;lighter&quot; water with fewer ions. This seems to let the coffee speak a bit more. I find the lightly mineralized water out of my RO unit works well, this has a remineralization cartridge which adds in some of these ions (but nothing else). For those not looking to go that far bottled water typically has a composition on the label which you can use. You can treat the water with a filter jug (for example) but the quality is directly tied to the quality of your tap water. . Another important consideration is the grinder you use. The general consensus is you want to have a flat burr grinder as opposed to a conical burr grinder for lighter roasts since they can produce a more uniform grind distribution. A rule of thumb is the bigger the burrs the better the grinder, but there are exceptions and things like alignment matter as does burr speed. That&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t get good quality light roast espresso with a conical just typically the flat burr grinders are preffered. . Moving onto the dialing in process itself, in my experience there are 2 variables that really make the difference with light roasts: brew temperature and ratio. Generally you will want a hotter brew for a lighter roast in my experience, the acidity &quot;turns into&quot; sweetness with a high temperature (I&#39;m aware that&#39;s not correct at a chemical level). But you have to be careful, turning up too high and you lose everything, all the flavours are lost and you&#39;re left with a cup of &quot;brown&quot;. Very small changes make a big difference, if your machine doesn&#39;t have temperature control then you can often &quot;temperature surf&quot; by pulling blank shots to vary the temperature but you don&#39;t have quite the same control obviously. . The ratio of an espresso is the weight of liquid you are left with versus how much dry ground coffee you put into the portafilter. A typical ratio for a &quot;normal&quot; espresso is 2:1 - say you put 18g coffee in the basket then you&#39;d pull a shot that gives 36g of liquid. For lighter roasts longer is generally better, sometimes even up to &quot;lungo&quot; range of 3:1 or even more. Pulling the shot longer again accentuates the sweetness. However in doing so you lose body and if you go too far you&#39;ll end up with a weaker &quot;watery&quot; type shot that is not enjoyable. As a starting point 2.5:1 is generally my go to and I adjust from there. . If you read a guide online to dialing in espresso there will be a lot of talk about &quot;timing&quot; and how the &quot;perfect&quot; shot will take 27-32s to pull. While this might be a decent yardstick for a more normal roast for light roasts this will lead to disappointment in my experience. Lighter roasts like to be pulled in a different way, typically a longer slower pre-infusion stage (this lightly saturates the puck with water to &quot;prime&quot; it and raise the temperature of the coffee puck) followed by a much quicker pull - possibly in the region of 20s. I don&#39;t use timing as a variable I &quot;target&quot; I let the timing fall as it falls but I keep a note of it for consistency reasons, if I&#39;m pulling a shot again and it&#39;s much slower/quicker it might suggest I&#39;ve done something else incorrectly in my prep! . There are a few other smaller considerations that seem to help in my experience: firstly tamping, a light tamp is your friend (up to a point!) tamping hard is unnecessary and seems to lead to more channeling and other issues. I also like to dose less with light roast coffees whereas I might normally dose 18g for a more developed roast I might go down as low as 15g for a particuarly light roast as that seems to work a bit better. In addition to this I find that underdosing a basket (e.g. putting those 15g of coffee into an 18g basket) helps with ensuring the pre-infusion is slower and more gentle - although this might just be an artefact of the setups I have used rather than a universal truth. . But back onto Bumbogo itself: starting as always with the filter. We have the typical &quot;red berry&quot; Rwandan type thing coming to the front. Assembly describe this as a &quot;cranberry&quot; note which I don&#39;t disagree with at all - it has that slightly tart/sour note in there. This is supported with a caramel or burnt sugar sort of note which helps balance the acidity. I like to taste the coffees before reading the tasting notes and one thing I wrote down is a green grape like finish which Assembly did not note. Overall it is quite a clean tasting coffee but with a thick syrupy sort of body. It is not the most complex coffee I&#39;ve ever had but it is certainly delicious. Onto the espresso I was a little amazed at just how forgiving this was, I struggled to make a &quot;bad&quot; shot. I found that it worked best at very high temperatures and around a 2.2:1 ratio. There the cranberry and red currant notes really come to the front and the body is syrupy and has hints of a heavy red wine like quality. Overall a very good little coffee! . This weeks album is likely to be a little contenious: Frank Zappa - The Grand Wazoo: . . Some may argue &quot;but this is not jazz!&quot; - but I&#39;ve never been particularly concerned with defined boundaries to musical genres, some of my favourite albums straddle the line between multiple styles. This might mean the jazz police will knock down the doors of JazzCoffeeStuff HQ but that&#39;s a price worth paying. . Over the years Frank made some rather disparaging comments about jazz which didn&#39;t do much to endear him to the jazz community. However looking at the personnel in some of his bands I think it&#39;s safe to say we should take some of the comments at face value, many great jazz musicians played with him over the years. He also famously had Mahavishnu Orchestra open for him on a few tours, the experience left such an imprint that Frank completely tore down his band a built a new band and sound up in its place.In addition he wrote a piece dedicated to Eric Dolphy (although not on this album) - if Eric didn&#39;t die so tragically young we can only imagine what would have happened had he recorded with Frank. I find the &quot;Dolphy influence&quot; quite strong through a lot of Franks work, I can only assume it is through the love both of them share for composer Edgar Varese. . Frank composed, recorded and released this album in 1972 while he was in rehab following his assault by a fan in London a year earlier. It follows on in the vain of Waka/Jawacka which itself follows on from Hot Rats in terms of Frank&#39;s jazz-fusion offerings. . The Grand Wazoo is a bit of an outlier in the Zappa back catalogue. It features a large band (22 members) and some brilliant arrangements. It is possibly the &quot;jazziest&quot; of Frank&#39;s jazz fusion offerings. I have to admit I sometimes struggle with fusion when it attempts to employ a &quot;rock&quot; feel. A big part of rock is the attitude and often on fusion records a jazz guy will add some distorted guitars and think that is enough and the whole thing ends up sounding nerdy rather than cool. Given Frank is at home in a rock context the blend is much more seemless than many. The album is almost entirely instrumental apart from a few vocal lines on &quot;For Calvin (And His Next Two Hitch-Hikers)&quot; (which tells a narrative of 2 warring musical factions according to the liner notes). . The modern classical influence is also noticable on this album. Given when it was released this was probably one of the first examples on record of Frank playing with these ideas, the time spent alone following the assault probably gave him a chance to better explore these ideas. . For me the two standout pieces are the two closing tracks. &quot;Eat That Question&quot; (embedded above) is an absolutely raucous affair starting off with a short intro from jazz-keyboard maestro and long-term Zappa collaborator George Duke. Before breaking into the main theme which is one of the strongest melodies in the Zappa canon and one he came back to many times when performing live. . The final track on the album is called &quot;Blessed Relief&quot;: This is a much more mellow and chilled out affair. However the melody isn&#39;t any less strong and features some absolutely beautiful arrangement. Some Zappa tunes can get a bit &quot;complicated for the sake of complicated&quot; which sometimes has its place, however on this one we see Frank is just as able to write a &quot;straight&quot; tune. . As a guitar player Frank was always what I consider a &quot;visceral&quot; player, he doesn&#39;t aim to have perfect technique he just plays what he feels. Most of the time he solos over one chord vamps, sometimes for 10-20mins at time. Many guitarists look down on him for this but being able to play for an extended time over a one chord vamp is a real skill, you very quickly end up aimlessly noodling without any changes to drive your ideas forward. It is always noticable on Zappa records where the supporting musicians solo over the changes of the compositions but when it comes time for Frank&#39;s turn they revert to a simple vamp. On &quot;Blessed Relief&quot; however we are treated to hearing Frank play the changes, which is certainly note worthy in itself! He doesn&#39;t approach this in the way a jazz player might and he&#39;s only following the changes in a fairly loose sense but it is great to hear. . Perhaps the most &quot;jazzy&quot; of all the pieces on show however is the title track &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; (depending on the pressing you own of the record this may be the first or the second track!) Clocking in at over 13 minutes it is by far the longest and most ambitious piece on the record. While the tempo is quite frantic the music itself slowly glides through the various themes and motifs present throughout the piece. In some sense it has the &quot;swan like&quot; quality of many of the successful jazz big-bands - elegantly gliding along but under the surface paddling manically! There are some brilliantly wild brass and woodwind solos dotted throughout the piece but it is really the arrangement itself that is so memorable. You could easily dedicate a blog post (or more) analysing every technique and trick on show here but ultimately the proof is in the listening: Overall I consider this album one of the strongest in the Zappa catalogue and one certainly worthy of your time. .",

            "title": "Expectations and Assembly Raimutin",
            "content": "In this blog post we&#39;re heading back to Assembly coffee roasters located in Brixton, London. For my money Assembly are consistently one of the best roasters in the country and one of my favourites since they seem to share very similar taste preferences to me - no matter what I buy from them I&#39;m always left impressed. . The coffee this week is called Raimutin, it is naturally processed and is made up of a lend of Timor, moka and typica varietals. In a previous blog post we learned that &quot;most coffee varietals can trace their lineage back to either typica or bourbon&quot; - in this case that is not true. To understand the Timor varietal we need to take a step further back in coffees history. Coffee plants can be split into two broad camps: Arabica and Robusta (there are a few others but they&#39;re rare and for arguments sake this is a good description). The &quot;typica-bourbon&quot; lineage exists in the arabica side. Arabica is typically favoured for higher cup quality and depth of flavour - specialty coffee is almost entirely dominated by Arabica. The &quot;downsides&quot; of arabica are lower yields and lower caffeine content. The Timor varietal is essentially a hybrid between arabica and robusta. It retains a lot of the robusta hardiness and is more resistant to leaf-rust, pests, etc. while retaining some of the arabica cup quality. . Raimutin is from the country of Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. You would be forgiven for not having heard of this country before since it only found its sovereignty in 2002. It shares a small island with Indonesian-Timor to its south-west. It is located in south-east Asia - between Indonesia and Australia. For those who enjoy a pub quiz it is also the only Asian country to be entirely located in the southern hemisphere. In recent years coffee production in Timor-Leste has increased and every now and again their coffees pop up in quality roasteries. . I have to admit I am not usually a fan of Asian coffees, I tend to find them a bit heavy for my taste and they often seem to have &quot;smokey&quot; or &quot;tobacco&quot; style notes I personally do not care for (although I understand why people love them). I have heard through the grapevine that the &quot;best&quot; Asian coffees do not leave the area and you have to travel to the area to really try the best the area has to offer. Having never travelled there let alone tasted coffee there I don&#39;t know if there is any truth to this. Since this coffee was roasted by Assembly I thought I&#39;d try it however as I&#39;ve yet to have a coffee from them I disliked (in fact this is my second bag of this coffee - I ordered a &quot;mystery bundle&quot; of a random selection of coffees and this one was included.) . I can&#39;t mention the Assembly roastery without mentioning the packaging, the most stylish beautifully designed packaging I have ever seen! Plus they&#39;re not foil backed bags so they&#39;re easy to recycle which is a positive. I know many will say packaging doesn&#39;t make a difference, but I disagree entirely. From the moment you pick up a bag of coffee you make subconcious assessments about it. These definitely carry over to the cup. Unfortunately with current world events it appears they are struggling to source their usual bags so the coffee arrived in &quot;interim packaging&quot; (their phrasing) which is still quite nice (but not quite as elegant as the usual offering). What I really like about the Assembly aesthetic is their &quot;paint swirl&quot; logo designs. For this particular coffee this is: . . I don&#39;t know if I have a very mild form of synesthesia or what but I definitely taste &quot;in colour&quot; - by which I mean the first thing that pops into my head when tasting anything is &quot;this tastes green&quot; or &quot;this tastes yellow&quot;, it then takes me a while to translate this &quot;green&quot; into a grape or the &quot;yellow&quot; into a banana flavour note. I tend to find the paint swirls for individual coffees to be a good match to the flavour notes of the coffee inside. . Starting off in the usual way with a pour-over filter brew: the first thing that hits me in the face is &quot;purple&quot; - in this case for me this is shows as plum and cherry brandy. I tend to find some natural processed coffees to have this &quot;boozy&quot; fortified alcohol sort of quality to them and this one certainly has that. However it is not a super-funky natural, there is some funk there but it is more a Bruno Mars pop record influenced by funk rather than a full blown George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic. The mouthfeel of the coffee is big and juicy yet it still remains fairly &quot;clean&quot; tasting for a coffee of this style. There is some acidity cutting through the sweetness and body however, for me it takes the form of a lime sharpness and it really helps balance everything out. I find this one needs to cool down a bit before it really comes alive. . Moving onto the espresso (in the last blog post we didn&#39;t touch on espresso so it&#39;s nice to bring it back) - for me this is where it really shines. The big body really comes to the forefront and you are left with a really pleasing thick shot even when you pull it slightly longer (which is recommended). The boozy notes are still there in force and it is really rich and indulgent. The acidity is still there but it&#39;s just there for ballast to support the bigger bolder notes. For a fairly light roast coffee I find this one of the easiest to pull espressos out there, it is super forgiving and you can really swing the grind settings around and still get super tasty shots out of it. My &quot;recipe&quot; for this one was 16.5g of coffee in to 38.0g of coffee out. I set the temperature of my machine to almost as high as it goes. I pre-infuse for around 5-10s and then my shot time comes in at around 22-24s. For me this is the sweetspot - you still get the lovely indulgent mouthfeel but it&#39;s long enough that the flavours don&#39;t get too lost. . Overall a super fun enjoyable coffee! In both filter and espresso there is a (very) long aftertaste which is satisfying, it pretty much mimics the flavours in the cup itself and is clean and pleasant, no hint of any sourness or acrid qualities that sometimes come with these long aftertastes. . To pair with this coffee I have settled on an album from 1972 from Keith Jarrett called &quot;Expectations&quot; . . The album was released on the Columbia record label, Jarrett having recorded with Miles Davis on this label previously. It is Jarrett&#39;s only record on Columbia under his own name. He then moved onto the ECM label and played a large part in the success of that label. . At JazzCoffeeStuff I try and not be negative but I am going to break that rule today. Not through the music on this album or Jarrett&#39;s music in general which is fantastic, but about the man himself. Jarrett has always tried to paint himself as a &quot;saviour&quot; or &quot;holier than thou&quot; sort of figure which I&#39;ve personally never taken to. As a result he essentially bans any extraneous noise in his concerts, as a result they have an atmosphere more akin to a morgue than to a place of enjoyment. For me the community aspect and audience &quot;participation&quot; of a jazz concert is part of the magic, cutting that out kills the music. I know he&#39;s trying to elevate the music to that of &quot;high art&quot;, and I get that, but for me it loses all that is important about the art form. I remember a few years ago he was playing at the London Jazz Festival (I didn&#39;t go to that particular concert) and through a friend I understand he heard a &quot;whirring&quot; in the audience so stormed off stage - it turned out to be a person in a wheelchair. Eventually he was persuaded to come back on stage but offered nothing in the way of an apology. I have heard plenty of other &quot;horror stories&quot; about his concerts, it&#39;s a real shame. . My second complaint with Jarrett is the &quot;Jarrett grunts&quot; - when improvising he will very loudly grunt and it is completely atonal and has nothing to do with what he&#39;s playing. He doesn&#39;t need to do it because I&#39;ve heard him play many times without doing so, I&#39;m not really sure why he does this. You can here some of this in the clip below (but take nothing away from the sheer quality of the piano playing) With those rants out of the way lets get onto the album itself. Thankfully in 1972 Jarrett hadn&#39;t yet gone &quot;full grunt&quot; and so there isn&#39;t a whole lot of this to distract on the album. After a short introduction piece the album kicks off proper with &quot;Common Mama&quot; (embedded at the start of this blog post) - and what a start it is. Keith is joined by Paul Motian on drums, Charlie Haden on the Bass, Sam Brown on guitar, Dewey Redman on tenor sax and Airto Moreira on percussion. In addition there are uncredited string and brass sections. The main melody of Common Mama is so strong you can be humming it for weeks after hearing it. By having both drums and percussion the rhythm section is really grooving and it allows Dewey a chance to really let loose and get wild! The combination of Motian/Haden/Redman is something you&#39;re more likely to hear on a purely &quot;free&quot; album, it is interesting to hear them in the context of &quot;prettier&quot; music. . The free side doesn&#39;t stay hidden for long however and by track 4 &quot;Roussillion&quot; we&#39;re treated to a piece that wouldn&#39;t be out of place on an Ornette Coleman album. In fact the main melody itself does have a tinge of &quot;Lonely Woman&quot; about it. Motian is absolutely in his element here driving the complex melody throughout and directing the soloists with ease. Motian is one of my favourite drummers in that respect and is probably deserving of more kudos than he gets. Being a double album there is a lot of music on show, and it is an extremely eclectic mix. Ranging from the more latin world-music influences of the opening number, through more typical &quot;Jarrett&quot; classically inspired pieces through to the rampant free-jazz. Along the way there&#39;s also glimmers of soul-jazz and jazz-rock fusion and at points even &quot;calypso&quot;. As a result this is quite a hard record to &quot;classify&quot;, it is almost a microcosm all to itself. That is probably why this is an often overlooked album in the Jarrett back-catalogue. However it shows what a tremendous talent Jarrett has as a band leader, composer and improviser. For my money it should be celebrated as a masterpiece and one record that is surely worth your time. We&#39;ll end with the beautiful title track which is definitely the &quot;most Jarrett&quot; piece on the album: .",

            "title": "Clifford Brown & Max Roach and Gold Box Cupping",
            "content": "For my tenth post on this blog we&#39;re going to do something a bit different this week. Instead of focussing on one particular coffee we are going to look at many! I purchased a &quot;taster&quot; pack from the folks at Gold Box Coffee Roasters and decided to do some cupping! Unfortunately the tasting packs are small (around 30g each) and so I will not be able to talk about espresso this week (but that will surely change in the next installment). . I bought one sample in particular that I did not want to form part of the cupping as I wanted to investigate it fully. It is a Bolivian Gesha varietal with a semi-anaerobic processing. This is one of the &quot;fancy new&quot; processing methods that has sprung up in recent years, in essence we can think of most of these as being variations on a natural processing but with more measurement/controlled conditions. In this case the coffee spends part of its processing life in sealed air-tight containers where the fermentations can be controlled. I tend to find these experimental processing methods a bit hit and miss, sometimes they produce wild and interesting flavour notes but sometimes they will impart a &quot;hollow&quot; vibe somewhat akin to a decaf process in my opinion. . Bolivia is one of my favourite origins, when I was first getting into specialty (c2008) there were a lot of Bolivians on the market and they form some of my favourite early coffee memories (I remember a particuarly good one from Monmouth and a few from Hasbean). However over the years the specialty coffee production has decreased in the country owing to the country allowing the growth of Coca (used to make cocaine) which offers more dependable money to farmers, sadly as a result many coffee plants have been torn out and possibly lost forever. There are still some high quality coffees coming out of the region however. . The Gesha varietal has become a bit of a poster-child for the specialty industry lately, in any barista/roasting competition it has basically become a showcase for Gesha varietals. The varietal is believed to have originated in Ethiopia but it rose to prominence thanks to a particular farm in Panama which bumped the price of the varietal into the stratosphere. The varietal itself produces very floral and fragrant coffee. The flavour profiles tend to be delicate or muted but they are notoriously &quot;marmite&quot; with some people not liking them at all. I&#39;ve had my fair share of Gesha and while it&#39;s great I don&#39;t like to spend the big bucks on them as I tend to find the value proposition is better elsewhere. This particular coffee from Gold Box, however, piqued my interest because I have never had a Bolivian Gesha so wanted to give it a go. . I&#39;m really glad I gave it a try! But I&#39;m a little annoyed at myself for not buying a full bag (I had 50g only - about 3 cups worth). It is a truly special coffee, it has that delicate floral nature and all the fragrance you would want. There is a strong ginger note to it too which I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve noticed in another coffee before. With the floral nature it is a little like having a good quality black tea and a ginger nut - but all in one cup! It&#39;s complex enough to keep you interested and coming back for more yet not so challenging as to be a distraction from whatever else you are doing. I would describe both the sweetness and acidity as medium, it is very down the middle (in a good way). There is some body there but not too much, you still get a lot of clarity in the cup. There is no hint of the &quot;emptiness&quot; of a fancy processing method, I&#39;m not sure whether if this is because it has only spent part of its life anaerobically or whether it is just done particuarly well. Overall I&#39;m very impressed with it, I would certainly buy again and I&#39;d love to see how it performs as an espresso (Geshas tend to be a bit difficult to dial in). Hopefully this is a sign of things to come with the cupping! . I&#39;ll quickly outline my cupping methodology, I don&#39;t follow a specific guideline and I like to do things a little differently to some. I am not a professional cupper nor do I do it very often. Coffee should be fun however so with any method you should tailor it to suit you! In total I have 8 coffee samples from various origins. As soon as the coffee arived I removed the labels and replaced them with a randomly generated 3 alpha-numeric identifier (storing the key on my computer to look up after!) I like to use codes like this when blind tasting as opposed to &quot;coffee 1&quot; or &quot;coffee A&quot; as that naturally sets up an expectation that &quot;1&quot; is better than &quot;2&quot; and so on. I then left the coffees for a week so that there would be very little chance I&#39;d remember the codes I set up (it&#39;s safe to say it worked, I can&#39;t even remember what origins there were let alone specific coffees!) So this is about as blind as I can make a test on my own. . . For the cupping itself I used 7.5g of coffee to 125g of 100 degree water. I lined the bowls with filter paper so I could scoop out the grinds in one go (I hate the gritty feeling of grinds in the bowl so I removed them - I know this is not traditional). I grind fairly coarse at around a french press level and I leave them to brew for 3 minutes before removing the grinds. I do not like doing large cuppings with many different coffees as I find it hard to keep track so I broke the 8 coffees into 2 groups of 4. On the first day I cupped 4 and selected the best 2, the second day I took the other 4 and selected the best 2 and on the final day I took the &quot;winners&quot; and played them off against each other to find which one I enjoyed most. . There are many different types of scoring one can use, I prefer a simple scoring system. I have 5 categories: Aroma (broken down into dry and wet), Acidity, Sweetness, Body and Aftertaste. Each gets a score out of 10, I sum them up and double it to get a score out of 100. I then allow myself an &quot;adjustment&quot; to that score should I feel it needs it, for example a coffee may not have a lot of body but overall I like the taste more than another so want to correct for that. This is only in exceptional circumstances however, typically the score will not be adjusted. My scoring does not match the SCA system in any way. Since I only cup coffees that are specialty grade that have already passed numerous tastings it&#39;s unlikely I&#39;ll find anything under an 80 on the SCA scale - my scoring gives we scope to go below this if needed. . . I will just briefly summarise my findings: . Day 1 . YEY - Tis coffee presented with a fruity round smell. The acidity was delicate with a dried cranberry sort of vibe. The sweetness was very high and there wasn&#39;t too much body. The aftertaste was clean and fairly shortlived. 73/100 | INQ - A big punch in the face of a coffee. Strong caramels and nuts combined with dried and fragrant stone fruits on the nose. Fairly high in acidty and syrupy sweet. Not much mouthfeel but a big body. Aftertaste was neutral. 80/100 | TYH - Not much of anything at all, it&#39;s as if the coffee is a bit stale. These came vac-packed without roast dates so it might be an old sample. 56/100 | TUU - A medium sweet medium acidity coffee with a lower body. In the aftertaste I picked up a note I wasn&#39;t 100% happy with so given the strength of competition it got marked down harshly. 60/100 | . Day 2 . OWR - Cherry and red-fruit aromas with caramels and honey. The acidity was nice and balanced and easy to drink. The sweetness reminded me of rosehips with a hint of florals. Overall very good. 73/100 | M2X - Just not my sort of coffee, heavy, dense, thick. Very nutty and chocolate-y with a malty-biscuity sort of vibe. Nothing wrong with it, just not for me. 60/100 | CXH - Similar to OWR - it was difficult to seperate these two. Very sugary sweet with honey-like qualities. Overall OWR pipped it to the post thanks to the subtle floral note. 72/100 | K2E - Now this was a complicated coffee. Totally different to the others so hard to compare them fairly. So many florals! Also a peachy-blueberry sort of fruitiness. This one came alive when it cooled down. It is not particularly sweet or acidity so the score suffers a bit. 74/100 | . The Playoffs . Now moving onto finding the best of the best. The finalists are: INQ, K2E, YEY and OWR - ranked by their first round scores. As I&#39;m not a professional cupper nor do this often enough I do not put much weight on my scores day to day - it&#39;s highly swayed by my mood or whatever else I have eaten/done that day! My findings on the final cupping day were: . OWR - The honey caramel notes on the nose are more prominent. I&#39;m picking up an orange note this time more than a red-fruit vibe. Again the acidity was balanced and not overpowering at all. In terms of sweetness this was the sweetest on show for me, the honey caramels really shining through. Probably the thinnest body of all of them however. The aftertaste is punchy with orange and caramel but it dissipates very quickly and doesnt linger. Overall very easy to drink but a touch one-dimensional. 72/100 | INQ - Much as before this one is a power-house absolutely out-muscling the other coffees on show. If you&#39;re after a flavour-bomb this one is probably it! There are chocolates and caramels there but also a lot of dried and stone fruits and through it all still a floral note underlying it all. It has the biggest body of all on show. Despite its power the aftertaste is not too overbearing and does not linger too long. 79/100 | K2E - Again the most complex coffee here by quite a long way. Super interesting and at a certain temperature it just comes alive. Florals are the name of the day, it is like filling your mouth with lavendar and rose petals. This is combined with a peach-y sweetness and a creamy mouthfeel. The aftertaste is highly perfumed and lingers a long time. 81/100 | YEY - Red-fruits are prominent on the nose throughout combined with a caramel note. The acidity is crisp and reminds me of a green apple or a lime. The red-fruits come out in the sweetness in the form of cherry candy! As it cools a floral note presents itself. It is neither as sweet as OWR nor as floral complex as K2E. The aftertaste is sweet and long lasting. 76/100 | . So there we have it the winner is: K2E. Noting that this is just my pallette. There are a couple of other things I noticed before I look at what the coffees actually were: . OWR and CXH are remarkably similar | I would be very surprised if K2E is anything other than an Ethiopian (I would guess a Guji natural if pushed) | I don&#39;t have a clue what INQ is - it has many different qualities. Whatever it is it is done well! | OWR has to be a honey processed coffee from the Americas - I&#39;m thinking Costa Rica | I think M2X has to either be a Brazilian or a particularly heavy Colombian | The Reveal . The coffees were: . K2E - Hambela Halaka (Ethiopia Natural) | INQ - Bolivia Caranavi (Bolivia Washed) | YEY - Rwanda Ruvumbu 035 (Rwanda Washed) | OWR - Costa Rica Juanachute Canet (Costa Rica Honey) | CXH - Costa Rica Los Urena (Costa Rica Honey) | TUU - Los Pirineos Pacamara (El Salvador Natural) | M2X - Brazil Santo Andre Mondo Novo (Brazil Natural) | TYH - Ethiopia Rocko Mountain (Ethiopia Natural) | Thankfully most of my predictions turned out to be reasonable! I don&#39;t have to hand in my membership card to the coffee bloggers union. It is interesting that the Ethiopian Rocko Mountain was last - this is a coffee I have had many times before from various roasters and always enjoy. It just had no oomph in this test, it could be the preperation method, user error or slightly stale beans. But I do usually find Rocko is better suited to espresso. It is also interesting that I couldn&#39;t place the Bolivian coffee as stated above the production yields have fallen drastically in recent years and so I&#39;ve not been able to drink as much as I would like so am less familiar than I used to be. . It is also interesting that the ordering of the coffees ended up pretty much matched my expectations - that is if you just listed these coffees and made me put them in preference order it would very closely match this list (minus the Rocko anomoly). . The Jazz . With all the coffee stuff taken care of let&#39;s move onto this weeks jazz. Usually I try and link the jazz to the particular coffee or theme I want to write about. This week I can&#39;t really do that so it is a completely free choice, which is tough. I ultimately decided on an absolute classic released in 1954: &quot;Clifford Brown &amp; Max Roach&quot; - with which we can hardly go wrong. . . Released on the Verve record label this was a highly anticipated record. Clifford Brown and Max Roach being titans of their field, there was hope that this would pave a new path for bebop in the 50s following on from the earlier Bird and Diz work of the 40s. The record did not disappoint and instantly got recognised as one of the most important jazz records to date. The line up on the record is: . Clifford Brown – trumpet | Harold Land – tenor saxophone | George Morrow – bass | Richie Powell – piano | Max Roach – drums | . Of course Brown and Roach are the &quot;stars&quot; here but what really stands out to me is the call and response interplay between Brown and Land. It is one of the greatest examples of this interplay ever put onto a record. They work together seemlessly creating highly intricate shared ideas that never feels like &quot;8 bars for you, then 8 for me&quot;. This is displayed clearly on the 2nd track &quot;Parisian Throughfare&quot; (embedded at the start of this post). . Of course the power and restless energy of Roach keeps the whole thing moving along. This is not easy to do, it is all to easy to lose sight of the swing and just start throwing chops at a tune. Max, and the other top tier drummers, actually listen to the music and only let loose when the music calls for it. . The understated work of Morrow should also not be understated, with everything going on in the music there is always a need to keep things grounded. The musician filling that role rarely gets the recognition they deserve so this is a shout out to George Morrow in that regard. . Another interesting part of this album is the juxtaposition of the harder bebop-focussed tunes paired with simple sweet lyrical ballads. It makes for an album that keeps you on your toes from start to finish. A great example of this is a beautiful take on the standard &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; Here Richie Powell (who did not quite reach the level of stardom of his brother Bud) absolutely shines through with understated lyricism and beauty, he and George Morrow fitting together perfectly. Max Roach leaving his ego at the door picks up the brushes and plays, perhaps, his simplest drum lines to date but it is just what the tune called for. Clifford Brown actually sits out the entire tune - on a tune that appears under your own name this requires a great deal of self control and keeping your ego in check! . Any talk of Clifford Brown is not complete without talking about his tone. His sound is completely recognisable, it is big round and warm. Unlike others at the time who were typically searching for a colder harsher sound. This inspired a generation of players including Lee Morgan, Donald Byrd and Freddie Hubbard through to later artists such as Roy Hargrove. To make the most of this sound he played longer flowing lines as opposed to the shorter stocatto trumpet lines that came before him. It is a shame he died so young (in a car crash) - we only have 4 years worth of his recording. Despite this he was and still is a huge inspiration, he achieved in 4 years what many musicians fail to achieve in a lifetime. . In jazz there are a few albums that are so great they are essentially &quot;no-brainers&quot; for me this is certainly one of them. .",

            "title": "Injuries and Long and Short Prince",
            "content": "In this blog we are looking at the last of my (current) order from the Long and Short roastery ( https://longandshort.london/ ) of the last few blog posts. . This time we are travelling to Burundi and the Tangara region. Burundi is a small east African country sharing borders with Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the west/south and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west. Given its shape it is sometimes called the heart of Africa. In recent years I have find Burundi to be one of the main challengers for &quot;most improved&quot; - every year that passes the cup quality seems to improve. Despite its small geographic size I also find great variety in the coffee from the country. . The particular coffee in question is called &quot;Prince&quot; - after Prince Bigayimpunzi who was a significant individual to the history of coffee farming in the Tangara region. As last week the varietal is a Bourbon, in particular red Bourbon. According to googlemaps this coffee was grown around 200km away from last weeks Rwandan &quot;Bingo&quot; - given they&#39;re both Bourbon varietals and naturally processed we would assume that the coffees would be remarkably similar: this is not the case. The Rwandan was polite, refined and not at all funky. In contrast the Burundi Prince is a wild child! . As I like to start with any coffee: on the nose we are punched in the face with berry fruitiness! It is really quite striking and is certainly intense. There are some supporting notes there too, a chocolate-y sort of smell and it gives the impression of &quot;sweetness&quot; but first impressions are this will be an acidity bomb! There is not a huge amount of &quot;funk&quot; on the nose, in fact it&#39;s difficult to really tell it&#39;s a natural. Based on smell alone I might guess it is a washed Kenyan, it gives off that sort of acidic fruit-bomb vibe. . Moving on, as always, to the filter: again I rely on my trusty Hasami Brewer. I&#39;ve not written much about brewed coffee yet in this blog so I will take a brief de-tour to talk about my set up and how I approach filter. . At heart I will always be a &quot;filter-boy&quot; - it is what first attracted me to coffee and is my most common form of coffee. I particularly love it for judging coffees as the coffees really speak for themselves when presented this way. I have tried (and still use) many different types of brewer, drip, pour-over, infusion, you name it! But for many years for me Chemex was king. One thing I always look for in a coffee is cleanliness, that is the quality I hunt down most - it is why I favour (much) lighter roasts than many. The Chemex with the very thick filter papers accentuates this quality in a coffee so it has always been a favourite of mine. If the pour-over world is split into Chemex and v60 fans I am firmly in the former camp! I also think as an item the chemex is a beautiful item to behold and an iconic design - I am a firm believer that we first taste with our eyes. Having a beautiful brewer/decanter and mug will improve how you perceive your coffee. . . However I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the performance of Chemex brewers. I find them quite finnicky and have a few issues. Most notably is that the &quot;funnel&quot; walls are smooth, this can cause the filter paper to &quot;stick&quot; to the sides and create a vacuum preventing the water from passing through the coffee. The pouring lip is meant to prevent this however it doesn&#39;t always work. It is certainly not an issue that affects every Chemex brew but it happens enough to make you angry when it does. Another issue I have with the Chemex is the glass walls mean heat escapes quickly, I believe the trick to good filter coffee is keeping things as warm as possible but the Chemex makes this a losing battle. Perhaps worst of all however is that the funnel and carafe are joined together and the neck is narrow, trying to clean a Chemex gets frustrating fast and they quickly look tatty. Not to mention how fragile they are, if you drop one it&#39;s likely it&#39;s gone for good! . My solution for a while was to instead use the v60 brewer and carafe but use the thicker Chemex papers. This is a fair compromise, the v60 has swirling &quot;ridges&quot; that reduce the chance of the paper sticking to the walls. You can pick up a plastic v60 cone for very little money so it is cost effective and long lasting. However unless you spend considerably more I don&#39;t find the v60 particularly visually appealing. About a year ago I came across the Hasami brewer, having bought some of their saucers to use for my espresso cups: . . It has a definite &quot;style&quot; but I am a big fan of the way it looks and feels. Like the v60 it has &quot;ridges&quot; (but straight instead of swirling) but they are deeper so if anything more effective. The brewer itself is &quot;insulating&quot; in the sense that it is made of hollow ceramic/porcelain which helps heat retention. It also comes with a &quot;lid&quot; that I like to place on between pours to further prevent heat loss (I&#39;ve not tested the efficacy of this but it makes me feel better!) It is also an easy clean which is a big plus. The Chemex papers provide a good fit. Overall I&#39;m very happy with it (although I do appreciate it is a very expensive brewer not offering much in the way of tangible benefit to a v60!) . My filter technique is generally quite simple and I do not change it very often. With filter I feel that if you&#39;re trying to &quot;dial in&quot; every coffee you&#39;re doing something wrong - you should look for a consistent technique that you can easily repeat. My technique involves (typically) getting the water very hot, I tend to set my kettle to 100c (although for certain coffees I might knock that back a few degrees depending). My grind setting is constant for all coffees, I do not vary it to target a specific drawdown time. I follow a &quot;pulse pour&quot; approach. I like to pour a small amount of water every 15-20s in order to keep the water level low in the brewer - I find this helps keep the extraction levels higher and helps with consistency. Unlike most others I do not favour agitation of the brew; the extraction yield isn&#39;t quite as high but for me the quality improves. The no-agitation approach increases clarity and cleanliness which is generally my main aim. For a typical cup I will use 14-15g coffee and 200g water - this ratio is a little higher than some suggest but it is where I like it, I feel the little extra coffee makes up for the lack of agitation in terms of total extraction but you end up with a cleaner cup out of it. I might pour 40g, leave for 30s then pour 20g of water every 15s as a typical recipe. Between pours I put the kettle back on to heat up if it needs it and I will place the Hasami lid on to reduce the amount of heat loss. . Back onto the coffee in question after this detour into the world of brewing: as a filter this coffee is fairly wild! The acidity is very prominent from the get go. Blackberries and redcurrants come through strong but this is balanced by a chocolate note and a sweet butterscotch taste and mouthfeel. It is an interesting cup for sure, very complex. Of the long and shorts this is my choice as a filter, it is just more &quot;my style&quot;. As is often the case with Burundi&#39;s there is a floral note I can&#39;t quite put my finger on also, I have a hard time describing it and it&#39;s not particularly loud but it is there. . Moving onto the espresso: again this is a wild child! The long and short roast profile again is more developed than my &quot;typical&quot; coffees which makes it very easy to pull shots from. If you wanted a &quot;gateway drug&quot; to the wilder more acidic espressos I don&#39;t think this one would be a bad starting point as it is so forgiving. Again the acidic blackberry-redcurrant notes are in the forefront and are by far most dominant. The acidity offers almost a &quot;drying&quot; experience in the mouth (but not in a bad way). There is enough sweetness to balance things out but it is not something I can really pinpoint down as a &quot;sugar&quot; or &quot;caramel&quot; or &quot;chocolate&quot; its just there to balance things. In terms of mouthfeel and body there is not much to talk about it is fairly &quot;thin&quot; - some may not like that but I&#39;ve never really placed much value on body. It is certainly a clean cup and thoroughly enjoyable. Again there is that floral note lingering in the aftertaste that I wish I could put a finger on, maybe I&#39;ll have to try some more floral tasting foods to try and really dig down into what this &quot;Burundi note&quot; is! . Just as this weeks coffee is a wild-child we also look at a wild album as this weeks jazz pairing: Angles 9 - Injuries. . . I have to admit I do not know a huge amount about the various &quot;Angles&quot; bands (led by saxaphonist Martin Küchen), there are many incarcerations in many &quot;sizes&quot; - this album being a nonet - or nine piece. This places it firmly in the &quot;big band&quot; camp, something I feel is being under-represented currently. This particular album was released in 2014 and was my first exposure to this band. The full personel are: . Alexander Zethson - piano | Andreas Werliin - drums | Eirik Hegdal - baritone sax | Goran Kajfes - cornet | Johan Berthling - bass | Magnus Broo - trumpet | Martin Küchen - alto and tenor sax | Mats Aleklint - trombone | Mattias Ståhl - vibraphone | . The music itself is more at the &quot;free&quot; end of jazz (which in itself is odd for a big-band) - but there is still great focus on creating a groove, this is &quot;free jazz&quot; for those that enjoy getting up on their feet and dancing. Some of the playing is wild and ferocious, intellectually stimulating and challenging. Yet they manage to keep thrings under control by not losing sight of the groove and relying on the occassional minimalist section to allow the music to breathe. This is a great example of why &quot;free jazz&quot; can still rely on great composition. . Angles 9 have a sound completely of their own, you can identify them within a playlist almost instantly. To me this is the sign of a great artist. Their sound is neither too modern nor too dated, it is just right in that sweetspot where you have some familiarity but it is not &quot;boring&quot;. You can tell every musician in the group plays with swagger and has complete confidence in each others abilities, if the musicians were even slightly on edge the whole thing would fall apart into one big mess. . The opening track (embedded above) &quot;European Boogie&quot; is an absolute fire-cracker that sets the stage for the rest of the album. It is bombastic, swinging and with just the right amount of ego. It also shows that this project is not just content on making music, they&#39;re also trying to make a statement as many of the earlier free-jazz adopters were. However unlike the negative outlook many jazz artists take (and rightly so) - this album presents celebration, peace and hope at the forefront. They manage to combine many cultures into the music seemlessly, from the African and Latin inspired percussive beats through European classically inspired melodies. It is &quot;fusion&quot; in the true sense of the word. The track &quot;Eti&quot; is another particular highlight of the album for me, it really captures the celebrative euphoria and just straight having fun. This is punctuated by the more minimalist freer sections, as if to show that &quot;low periods&quot; help accentuate the joy when it is there. What is also remarkable about this track is also the strength of the main theme, the melody itself reminds me of Russian classical pieces in particular. There are not many &quot;free&quot; albums where you will be humming the melody for days after you hear it. There are even fewer free-jazz albums that you feel like dancing too (admittedly a strange sort of dancing!) . The album is released on the Clean Feed record label out of Lisbon, Portugal. In recent years I have found this to be a highly dependable label. I like labels to have their own &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;style&quot;, this is something that the early labels had in spades. You can pick up any Blue Note recording from the &#39;50s-60s and you know what to expect. Cleanfeed does not hark back to the &quot;good old days&quot; trotting out tried and tested music, they&#39;re very ambitious. The music tends to be very free and experimental but never for the sake of it. It also helps that their recording quality is always top notch too, again they&#39;re progressive and modern - they aim for a very &quot;clean&quot; hi-fi quality to recording, not putting any &quot;faux-patina&quot; on during the recording to conjur up nostalgia. Yet the records remain open and warm, never cold nor clinical. Something that&#39;s very hard to do. . All in all &quot;Injuries&quot; can only be described, in this author&#39;s opinion, as a modern masterpiece. I don&#39;t like to make claims of &quot;album of the decade&quot; or similarly grandiose terms but for jazz released in the 2010s this has to be up there in any &quot;best of&quot; list. It is mindboggling to me this album did not get wide recognition. . I will leave with the track from the album: &quot;Ubabba&quot;. It is the least &quot;free&quot; of all the tracks but shows this band can still swing as hard as anybody else out there! Albeit in their very unique styling. After listening to free-jazz it&#39;s often nice to end on something more straight as a pallette cleanser: And there we have it: a wild coffee in Prince from Long and Short and some wild jazz from the boys in Angles 9. .",

            "title": "Fat Albert Rotunda and Long and Short Bingo",
            "content": "In this blog we are sticking with the Long and Short roastery ( https://longandshort.london/ ) from last time. Again we have another natural processed coffee, this time a Bourbon varietal from Rwanda called &quot;Bingo&quot; (with cupping score 87). . Typically Rwanda is known for their washed coffees, so it is a little unusual to find a natural coffee from there - not exceedingly so, but enough to be note worthy. The bourbon varietal is certainly ubiquitous throughout Rwanda however. Coffee varietals are important in the same way grape types are important to wine. From a preservation standpoint varietals are also important for genetic diversity, currently coffee plants are not particularly diverse and so highly susceptible to pests and disease. The creation of new varietals might help coffee survive long term. . Ethiopia is widely regarded as the birthplace of coffee and it is has the highest diversity of varietals (~95% of all varietals can be found in Ethiopia by some estimates). Outside of Ethiopia most coffee varietals can trace back to Yemen where there existed 2 main varietals: Typica and Bourbon (which is itself a mutation of Typica). Essentially every coffee outside of Ethiopia can trace its lineage back to Typica or Bourbon. . Bourbon takes its name from the island of Bourbon (now Réunion) where it was originally grown before being exported by the French to Latin America and Africa. Compared to Typica the Bourbon varietal has a higher yield (although still low yield compared to many other varietals.) Both are renowned for producing good quality coffee, unfortunately both types are highly susceptible to pests and disease which makes them hard to grow. Bourbon is in some sense &quot;the specialty coffee varietal&quot; given its prevelance and enduring popularity. To continue the wine analogy: &quot;Bourbon is the pinot-noir of the coffee world!&quot; The varietal can be further broken down into &quot;red bourbon&quot; (the original bourbon), &quot;yellow bourbon&quot; (a natural mutation of the red bourbon) and more recently &quot;orange/pink bourbon&quot; (another natural mutation). The colour names refer to the appearance of the coffee fruit prior to processing. . Onto Bingo itself: on the nose the beans give off a strong, rich caramel/burnt sugar sort of vibe - certainly enticing! As with the previous Long and Short coffee the roast level is what I would describe as a true medium-light: not a really light delicate filter roast but also not a medium where you start to see &quot;roasty&quot; notes that mask the natural acidity and sweetness in the coffee. As a filter this coffee shows a reasonable amount of complexity, there&#39;s certainly a tea note present which is strong upfront but also lingers as an aftertaste. The caramel note on the nose is also there but plays more of a supporting role. The real intrigue in the coffee is the blend of the sweetness and acidity - on the bag they describe it as &quot;bittersweet&quot; which is a very good description. As an espresso we are treated with a decent amount of mouthfeel and body. With this one I found pulling a little shorter helped stop the tastes getting lost. The flavour profile in the espresso is much like the filter although the caramel note is amplified somewhat and the tea note dialed back (especially in the aftertaste). All in all an enjoyable cup! . One thing we normally associate with natural coffees is &quot;funk&quot;, this coffee is not particularly funky. But this week&#39;s album is: . Originally appearing as the soundtrack to Bill Cosby&#39;s animated special &quot;Hey, Hey, Hey, It&#39;s Fat Albert&quot;. and released in 1969 &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; was Herbie Hancock&#39;s first dalliance with jazz-funk, a sound he would come back to with &quot;Head Hunters&quot; in 1973. Upto this point Herbie was known for his sophisticated harmony in more &quot;classic&quot; jazz settings and for his &quot;fusion&quot; work with Miles. &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; was instead heavily influenced by funk and soul music. . The album features quite a large ensemble cast of: . Herbie Hancock: Piano, Eletric Piano | Joe Henderson: Tenor Sax, Alto-flute | Garnett Brown: trombone | Johnny Coles: trumpet, flugelhorn | Buster Williams: electric, acoustic bass | Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath: drums | George Devens: percussion | . With additional appearances on some tunes. Having such a large core-band really adds to the funk/soul vibe and affords Herbie more freedom in arrangement. Again blog-favourite Joe Henderson appears to provide some fire-breathing solos, the funky backdrop allows him to show off some funky chops and get a little freer. This is Joe&#39;s 3rd appearance in 8 blog posts - no other blog offers as much Joe Henderson per square inch! . The album starts with &quot;Wiggle Waggle&quot; (embedded above), which is an all time classic. It&#39;s a tune I feel many people will recognise but may not attribute to Herbie, like a few other tunes in his repertoire. It is based around a simple 12 bar blues guitar riff with the horns providing embellishments. The music really grooves with an r&amp;b/soul vibe and Joe&#39;s solo is a wild start to an album. If you can listen to this track without, at least, tapping your feet you should probably go to your doctor and get them to check if you&#39;re missing the funk gene. . I usually find jazz artists tend to express themselves in one of three ways: some are melody driven, some are harmony driven and some are rhythmically driven. Herbie is part of a rare breed that is adept at all three and this album displays this. After listening you&#39;ll find yourself humming the melody of some of the pieces and while it&#39;s playing you&#39;ll get intoxicated with the groove. To break up the funk however there are a few harmonically rich jazz pieces. My choice cut being &quot;Jessica&quot; on side 2: Which showcases Herbie&#39;s skill for harmonic composition and arrangement, a piece he revisited on 1977s &quot;V.S.O.P&quot; album. It is one of my favourite Hancock compositions, it is made all the more striking and beautiful on &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; where it is bookended by &quot;Oh! OH! Here He Comes&quot; and the title track - both of which are fat greasy funk grooves through and through. . Another track of note is the 2nd on the first side: &quot;Fat Mama&quot;. The distorted guitar groove with more than a passing resemblance to &quot;Cissy Strut&quot; by The Meters (which was released around the same time). Instead of being pure Meters funk there is more sophistication in &quot;Fat Mama&quot; (as to be expected with Hancock). . Herbie is still out touring regularly and I have been fortunate enough to see him a few times live (I remember a duet gig with Chick Corea being particularly good!) Since he is such an &quot;all-star&quot; in the jazz world I&#39;ve only seen him in larger concert halls, I&#39;d love to get a chance to see him in a more intimate &quot;jazz club&quot; setting, although a gig like that would sell out almost instantly so I may need to take out a mortgage to fund tickets from a tout if that ever happens here in London. . The weather in London today is overcast and grey, strong winds and intermittent rain showers. On days like this you need comforting coffee and uplifting music: Bingo and &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; it is. .",

            "title": "The Natural Soul and Long and Short Dambi Udo",
            "content": "In this blog post we&#39;re going &quot;natural&quot;. At the moment I&#39;m finding most of the interesting coffees out there, at least the ones catching my eye, are naturals so it seems only fitting to embrace that. . To those that may be new to the coffee world by &quot;natural&quot; we are referring to how the coffee is processed before being roasted. A coffee &quot;bean&quot; is in fact a seed inside a coffee cherry fruit. The job of processing is to remove this fruit so that the beans are dried and ready to roast (and ultimately end up in tasty and delicious drinks). One option is &quot;washed&quot; processing where, as the name suggests, the coffee cherry is removed with water. Of all the processing methods this produces the &quot;cleanest&quot; cup since (essentially) all the cherry is removed. A &quot;natural&quot; processing method however involves leaving the bean inside the coffee cherry longer, typically in the sun. The natural sugars in the fruit ferment during this time. Eventually the fruit is seperated from the seed, producers have some control over how long the drying stage takes which can impact the qualities in the cup. Typically natural coffees are more complex, have bolder and wilder flavour profiles typically at the expense of being &quot;clean&quot;. In some cases where the fermentation stage is particularly long the coffee can take on &quot;funky&quot; characteristics, I tend to associate these with &quot;bruised fruit&quot; or &quot;fortified alcohol&quot; flavour notes. In the extreme they can taste slightly &quot;rotten&quot; which is a bit of a marmite thing, I&#39;ve not found many really funky naturals for a few years though. . The coffee in question this week comes from the Long and Short ( https://longandshort.london/ ) team in Walthamstow East London. I&#39;ve never purchased from these guys before but what caught my eye was an understated aesthetic and some rather high-quality coffees for reasonable prices. Coffee quality is often assessed using an SCA cupping score ranging from 0-100, to be called specialty the coffee needs a score of at least 80. The cupping score is not perfect but I find is a reasonable benchmark if looking at a new roaster. Typically I&#39;ll look for a score of around 87 or higher, this seems a good yardstick for me - going into the 90s typically means spending much much more dropping down to near 80 does not reduce the cost too much, it is a bit of a sweetspot in the diminishing return curve. To sweeten the deal Long and Short offer 20% off a first order if you sign up to their newsletter. Their regular prices are fair but 20% off is unbelievable - I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get much more bang for your buck, they must be selling at cost with the discount. . . The coffee I selected was called Dambi Udo, it is an Ethiopian from the Guji region and has an SCA score of 89. It is worth noting however that a single score like this cannot tell you anything about the flavour profile or even if you&#39;ll enjoy a coffee. If you hate really bright acidic cup profiles regardless of the SCA score a washed Kenyan might not be the one for you! Ethiopian naturals are really a &quot;tale of 2 halves&quot; in my experience - on the one side you get some really elegant fairly clean cups and on the other you can end up with complete madness (one of my most memorable cups of coffee ever was a particularly funky Yirgacheffe natural, it was right on the edge of being too &quot;rotten&quot; tasting but was a really smash in the face of flavours). The Dambi Udo is definitely on the more polite and elegant end of things. . in the interests of honesty this coffee is roasted slightly darker than my typical coffees. It is by no means dark, a medium-light is more of a fair description but I tend to go light to very light in my preferences. However by developing a bit further the acidity can be managed slightly. The result here is a very easy to drink cup that is very balanced, I&#39;m not feeling as though I&#39;m sacrificing anything by going a touch darker than usual. This also makes pulling espresso shots so much easier, I find this coffee incredibly forgiving - it&#39;s basically impossible to pull a bad shot if you get at least within the ballpark of a reasonable &quot;recipe&quot;. I find this one likes to be ground a bit coarser than others (like many natural Ethiopians in my experience) and only a medium sort of heat. I have had good results from pulling very short (1.85:1) to fairly long (2.5:1) - living up to the Long and Short name! . Onto the cup itself. After grinding the beans have a caramel and jammy sort of vibe on the nose for me along with some very delicate floral notes, very enticing. On the eyes the beans are quite clearly natural (I find there is a certain &quot;look&quot; to natural coffees) but on the nose there isn&#39;t a typical natural funk. In the filter we find the natural processing imparting body and mouthfeel which is really satisfying. The flavour profile is fruity though and through, there are tropical fruits like mangos and watermelons but also a blueberry type note. The caramel on the nose goes more to a sugar-syrup or jam in the cup, there isn&#39;t a hint of a &quot;roasty&quot; note. In the espresso I find this coffee amps up the jam even more both in texture and flavour. The floral notes also come out to play, if I had to describe the type I&#39;d suggest elderflower is an apt descriptor. The acidity is not too high at all in my opinion, I could see this being a good gateway for those that find African espresso too acidic. . If you&#39;re looking for a satisfying cup that is complex yet not too challenging I&#39;d certainly recommend the Dambi Udo. Especially for the discounted price it is truly exceptional. I also want to make a couple of shout-outs about Long and Short: . They win the record for the quickest turnaround of an order I can remember. From placing the order I got the tracking information for delivery within 17mins. Very very good! | It is nice to see packaging that is recyclable, many coffee bags are a pain to recycle but these bags can go into regular recycling (with the 2-way valve removed) | . The album in this blog is one slightly (but not massively) under the radar the 1962: &quot;The Natural Soul&quot; by Lou Donaldson. . The cover art is fairly typical in style with the black/white picture being brought to life with a flash of colour and the impactful block lettering. Lou Donaldson albums are somewhat synonomous with featuring beautiful women on the covers, but I believe this is the first one (jazz historians feel free to correct this!) &quot;The Natural Soul&quot; would have been all the more striking at the time for featuring an African-American woman with a &quot;natural&quot; afro hairstyle, kudos to Blue Note records for being willing to create cover art like this. . The music on this album represents one of the first &quot;Soul-Jazz&quot; records that came in the post-bop era for which Lou Donaldson was a major artist. Soul-Jazz focussed less on intense musicianship and blistering lead lines and more on groove taking inspiration from soul and r&#39;n&#39;b. The tunes were mostly variations on a blues or simply a one-chord vamp and the solos were all about blues-y lyricism. . The line-up on this album is simply incredible, Lou on alto, Tommy Turretine on trumpet, Grant Green on guitar, Big John Patton on organ and Ben Dixon on the drums. The Green/Patton/Dixon trio at the time being one of the pre-eminent organ trios around with a reputation for being one of the funkiest/grooviest. . The music presented is firmly in the Soul-Jazz tradition but with more than a foot remaining rooted in the blues. The opening track &quot;Funky Mama&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) is a perfect example with a hard hitting Soul-Jazz groove based around a 12 bar-blues. Most of the compositions take the form of a turnaround - for any musicians wanting to navigate a turnaround this album (along with many in the Donaldson catalogue) is a great place to start. Lou uses simple pentatonic blues phrases to great effect throughout, Green uses his minimalist style to keep the groove going and Big John Patton acts as the rock keeping things moving. To simply label the playing as &quot;simple blues&quot; is a mistake however, there is still plenty of bop virtuosity on display for example in the opening of side 2 &quot;Sow Belly Blues&quot; where the soloists let loose a bit more. Lou Donaldson (nickname &quot;Sweet Papa&quot;) was also known for his humour and this is certainly on display throughout the album with upbeat progressions and jokey expressions (although the music is anything but a joke). I was fortunate enough to see him live a few years ago, at the time he was nearing 90 years old but still put in a hell of a show. He may have needed to sit down, rest and take trips back stage while others were soloing but it was still a memorable gig. His humour was on display that night and he said 2 things that I will always remember: . &quot;This next tune is a Miles Davis number... You know, back when he actually played jazz.&quot; | A long talk about how in his old age his &quot;performance&quot; was suffering and his experiments with viagra (some of which cannot be printed in a family oriented blog like this!) | A great character, great performer and all around nice guy. He no longer performs live (at 93 years old at time of writing) so I feel fortunate to have got a chance to see him. . So if you&#39;re in search of something fairly easy to listen to that doesn&#39;t compromise on musicianship while providing fat grooves: &quot;The Natural Soul&quot; is not a bad way to go about it. .",

            "title": "Graffiti and PLOT Panchita Irureta",
            "content": "This weeks jazz album is the 2015 offering from JD Allen: Graffiti. I wanted to feature a more modern offering this time. In jazz it is all too easy to get caught up in history and yearn for the &quot;good old days&quot;, as such many modern artists seem to get overlooked. JD Allen is one such example, in my opinion one of the greatest modern players who deserves much more recognition for the work he is putting out. (This is exemplified by his allmusic.com entry which is woefully sparse and is missing all of his releases post 2013!) . . Seeing jazz being performed live is one of lifes great experiences, it is great listening to the old Blue Note records but nothing compares to the thrill of a great gig. I have seen JD a few times when he has performed in London, everytime a fantastic performance. Some artists rely on stage patter to lift performances, JD (and his group) does not instead letting the music speak for itself. This almost forces you to really pay attention to the music itself and the whole room feels &quot;part of something&quot;. If he is performing in your neighbourhood I&#39;d wholly recommend getting a ticket. . The album itself (Graffiti) is one of my favourites from him. It features Rudy Royston on drums and Greg August on bass, this rhythm section featuring on many Allen recordings upto 2019s &quot;Barracoon&quot; where he brought in some fresh blood. . The music on Graffiti walks that fine line between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot;, sometimes straying to an almost &quot;free&quot; structure but then pulling you back into something more comfortable. However there is a strong backbone of blues to everything to keep you grounded. There is almost a sensation of movement to the music, you can feel yourself being pushed and pulled by some external force as the music weaves between the swinging and the chaotic. . Many modern band leaders like to express themselves through dense harmonic structures, the music can feel somewhat rigid as a result as this closes off many avenues for improvisation since any solo has to essentially be a regimented tap dance to avoid falling down. This can be fun, but Graffiti instead keeps a looser feeling. Instead of relying on harmony for expression JDs music relies on rhythm to make a statement. . One of my favourite cuts on the album is the 2nd track: &quot;Jawn Henry&quot;. Allen&#39;s playing with the use of wolf tones in the main melody and the overall vibe reminds me of Joe Henderson (who is one of my all time favourite players). It has its own thing going however, there is the very evident JD DNA through the whole piece. Rudy&#39;s quite chaotic drumming helps fill the space in the composition and shows off some monster chops. Despite the technicality however Rudy manages to maintain a solid groove and swing which is no mean feat. With so much going on with the sax and drums you need a bedrock to keep things under control and this is where August comes in. You can tell this band is totally comfortable with each other, with music like this it can quickly turn into disaster if the band isn&#39;t tight. The track is a good illustration of the &quot;out but in&quot; vibe that JDs music is all about. . All the tracks on the album are solid, it is very consistent start to finish. It does not feel like any track is there as filler to turn an EP into an LP. The closing track &quot;Disambiguation&quot; reprises the main theme from &quot;Jawn Henry&quot; and acts to tie the whole album together and acts as a resolution leaving the listener satisfied. Some other tracks I particularly enjoy on the album are &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; which has some real swagger to it (and based on the name I assume is a tribute to Sonny Rollins who is clearly an influence). Another piece that sticks out is &quot;Indigo (Blue Like)&quot;, in the liner notes JD says: &quot;the most avant-garde thing that a jazz musician could do today is try to straight up and down swing&quot; and he is totally right. This tune swings hard but with some Monk inflections and humour thrown in along the way, you can tell they had great fun recording this. If you&#39;re looking for some &quot;no-nonsense&quot; hard hitting modern jazz that respects the past but isn&#39;t a prisoner to it; check out &quot;Graffiti&quot; through whichever medium you use to purchase your music. . The coffee this week is the last of my current batch from PLOT a Peruvian: &quot;Panchita Irureta Atipanaku Competition Lot&quot;. It is a fully washed Caturra coffee. Peru is not an origin I naturally gravitate towards, but for any real reason. Maybe it&#39;s just their seasonality coinciding with other origins that I favour. . As a filter you are greeted with a fairly rich and very sweet cup. Notes coming through cherry and a dark forest gateaux sort of vibe. There is also a reasonable amount of mouthfeel, texture and body to the cup. Both the flavour profile and the mouthfeel don&#39;t scream &quot;washed&quot; you would more naturally associate these things with some sort of natural processing, which is kind of interesting. On the acidity scale I would classify it as a medium, leaning more to sweetness than acidity on a sweet-acid scale. It&#39;s certainly an intriguing cup but despite the complexities it is (very) easy to drink and quite satisfying. . I have to admit I have struggled to dial in a great espresso with this coffee. It&#39;s not that the coffee is &quot;unforgiving&quot; (like say a light roast washed Kenyan that ends up like battery acid if you&#39;re not careful) - it is fairly easy to get something nice to drink, but getting it to shine took a bit of work. I&#39;m used to dialing in very light roasts (and this is a filter roast afterall and probably on the lighter end of filters even) - I eventually found something that works but it is a little counter-intuitive. Although this coffee is a light washed I found it better to think of it as a medium roast natural coffee (somewhat mimicking its flavour profile in the filter I guess). . My espresso machine is a Londinium-R lever machine. It is a fairly simple machine based around a spring-loaded lever group. It has the addition of a digital pre-infusion module that allows you to vary the pressure of the pre-infusion stage which is akin to changing the temperature on some other machines. This pre-infusion pressure is the only variable you really have with this machine. Personally I think this is great, I am not a fan of profiling machines in general as I feel you always end up with a sense of &quot;if only I varied XXXX a bit I could make this better&quot; - which leads to a lot of wasted coffee. . . For the bright filter roasts I use for espresso a general rule to follow for the best results is to get the machine very hot and pull a long shot (~2.5:1 typically) quickly (~22s). This does not work for this coffee however, following this procedure and you&#39;re left with something quite muted and flat. The major issue seems to be the heat, this coffee does not like heat at all! I dialed back to a temperature more suited to a medium roast espresso and things began to liven up. I than began to systematically fine the grind up a bit, reduce the volume of the shot and extend the time. I eventually settled on a &quot;typical&quot; espresso recipe of 2:1 in 27s. It&#39;s quite odd to pull a shot like this these days with the sorts of coffee I drink, usually the longest/slowest I&#39;d go is 2.2:1 and 25s and even that is rare. The results of the espresso investigation led me to change my filter technique for this coffee too, I usually set my kettle hot and re-heat between pours. With this coffee I reduced the temperature by 5 degrees celcius and didn&#39;t re-heat, the coffee thanked me for it (but I doubt I&#39;ll be using these settings for my next bag of coffee!) . Once dialled in however the coffee really speaks as an espresso, it&#39;s bold and vibrant with the black forest gateaux hitting you in the face with full force. As in the filter it&#39;s (very) sweet but there isn&#39;t a mountain of acidity. I could imagine this coffee not being too off-putting for those used to a more developed espresso roast, however being roast less means the flavours are incredibly clean. The mouthfeel is quite syrupy with lots of body, again it&#39;s a complex but satisfying affair. . Overall of the 3 PLOT coffees I tried this was (eventually) my favourite espresso of the 3, which is some achievement as they were all great in their own ways. You might need to work at it a bit but I think it&#39;s worth the hassle for the results in the cup! And it is especially to suited to being consumed while listening to JD Allen&#39;s Graffiti. .",

            "title": "Moanin and PLOT Abera Ararso",
            "content": "Following on from the previous blog post; the second coffee from my PLOT order is the Abera Ararso. This is a fully washed Ethiopian coffee from the Yirgacheffe region. Washed Yirgacheffes have become one of the icons of third wave specialty coffee, they tend to have high cup quality and a certain &quot;style&quot;. Over the years we have almost become spoiled by how great they can be. At the moment it&#39;s trendy to have ever more complex fermentations, drying and yeast based processes to gain more &quot;complexity&quot; in the cup - but for me nothing compares to a Yirgacheffe washed coffee. They&#39;re like your favourite jacket that can be dressed up or down, the Yirgacheffe can satisfy your lust for complex flavours yet at the same time is equally suited to when you just want a cup that is easy to drink on a lazy Sunday morning. . This particular example from PLOT is a very floral affair, not the &quot;loudest&quot; coffee you&#39;ll drink compared to say a natural process fruit bomb. However for a floral it still packs a hefty punch. As a filter there is also a fair amount of sweetness in the cup - it reminds me of candied lavender that you get in fancy cocktail bars. The cocktail comparison is probably fairly apt too as the cup oozes of sophistication and elegance. As with most washed Ethiopians there isn&#39;t a whole lot in the way of mouthfeel. As an espresso the florals pop even more especially on the nose - it is a very fragrant espresso. Washed Yirgacheffes are not always favoured for espresso since they can easily get lost in milk and can be a little too polite for some but personally I like them a lot. . On the bag the taste notes are listed as: &quot;Peach, Parma Violets and Bergamot&quot;. I feel these are fairly apt descriptors, the fragrant bergamot notes are particularly prominent to me. I usually try and ignore specifics in flavour notes when choosing coffee to buy, I tend to just look for &quot;trends&quot; for example: is the coffee floral? Stone fruits? Tropical fruits? and so on rather than hunting down a very specific note. I often seen new coffee drinkers post online &quot;I can&#39;t taste the XXXXX note, what have I done wrong?&quot; which I think leads to disappointment. I think the SCA&#39;s attempt to standardize taste descriptors through the flavour wheel is helpful as I feel as though the industry has got a bit carried away in recent years. Can anybody really tell me they can taste the difference between a coffee with a &quot;strawberry&quot; note versus one with a &quot;wild strawberry&quot; note? I feel as though these grandiose descriptors just lead to disappointment and turns more people away than attracts them to specialty. (Note: this is no reflection on PLOT who seem to use reasonable descriptions, it is just a topic that has been on my mind recently). . . One positive trend I&#39;ve seen with Ethiopian coffees in the past year or so is the movement away from the &quot;Heirloom&quot; varietal - for those readers who perhaps aren&#39;t as well versed in their terminology: a coffee varietal is roughly the equivalent to a grape variety in a wine. So while in wine you might have a chardonnay, pinot noir or malbec grape in a coffee you might have typica, red bourbon or caturra varietals. Ethiopia is widely considered the birthplace of coffee and occurs &quot;naturally&quot;, in other regions the coffee plants were introduced. By introducing specific strains and careful farming outside of Ethiopia it is fairly easy to identify the specific varietals on a particular farm. In Ethiopia the coffee plants are much much older, they have naturally evolved over time and so an individual farm may have many different varietals mixed together, some of which may never have even been classified. In the past the industry used the term &quot;Heirloom&quot; to denote an Ethiopian coffee with a &quot;mix&quot; of natural varietals. This is not ideal since different farms can be composed of entirely different varietals yet both be labelled the same. In the past year or so there has been a move to classify these varietals better. In the Abera Ararso from PLOT we have Kume, Diga and Wolisho varietals. Being relatively new names I haven&#39;t yet got a good handle on the characteristics of each - but hopefully in time I can gain a better understanding of these differences. . Since this weeks coffee is a classic, it feels only apt to pick one of the classic albums in Jazz history to pair with it. In this case I have settled on Moanin&#39; by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. . . The Jazz Messengers have a long and complicated history, originally formed via a partnership between drummer Art Blakey and pianist Horace Silver who left after a couple of years to lead solo projects under his own name. Thereafter Blakey became the leader and director of the group (but also released some music under his own name). Under Blakey the Jazz Messengers had a reputation for attracting young talent and &quot;making them stars&quot;. The groups alumni include some of the greatest names in jazz and one would have to include Blakey in any list of &quot;greatest band leaders&quot;. The Blakey mantra to band leading was to find talented youngsters and then &quot;getting out of their way&quot; rather than using the &quot;apprentice&quot; model that other senior band leaders often favour. . On this record the &quot;big name&quot; is Lee Morgan who would have been 20 years old at the time of recording, already having some noteriety from appearing on Coltrane&#39;s &quot;Blue Train&quot; a year or so earlier. However it wasn&#39;t until a few years after the release of &quot;Moanin&#39;&quot; that he became a household name. Although not quite having, in hindsight, the star power of Morgan the other musicians on the record are no slouches either: Benny Golson on tenor sax, Bobby Timmons on piano and Jymie Merritt on the bass. . As with most LPs on the Blue Note record label from the 50s and 60s Moanin&#39; features an iconic cover with the classic Reid Miles block lettering and a rather sombre looking Blakey (who is usually much more upbeat) in a photo by Francis Wolff. The Blue Note DNA runs through to the music too; during this time recording and rehearsal was relatively expensive. As a result many records released on other labels featured track lists mainly consisting of standards that they could record quickly in few takes. In contrast Alfred Lion and Blue Note paid for rehearsal time for the artists which allowed them to be more creative and develop new music. The album here featuring only one standard: Johnny Mercer&#39;s &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; as the final track, and even that has been largely reworked. All other tracks being originals. . The music itself is gutsy, soulful and with a clear influence from blues and gospel music. The late 50s was an interesting time for jazz music in general, be-bop had started to become a little stale. Artists were trying to find a new voice. Shortly after this jazz began to fragment into new sub-genres (as is the case with any music that lasts long enough). Blakey grew up with big bands and later became associated with be-bop groups - through the Jazz Messengers he became one of the figureheads of the hard-bop movement combining some of the hard hitting swing of big band with some of the dense harmonic structures of be-bop. . The album starts off with the title-track penned by Timmons, the opening motif being one of the most powerful and recognisable in all of jazz. Everybody on the record is on top form and they were clearly up for it. From Blakey&#39;s muscular powerful swinging groove, Timmons offering blues-y block chords and Lee Morgan offering up some killer soulful solos offering a glimpse of what is to come in his later career. The whole record has swagger, swing and total confidence - this is important in jazz records, the musicians often take great risks harmonically and played without confidence it leaves the listener on edge. Part of the beauty of jazz is the feeling of being &quot;in safe hands&quot; while doing something completely reckless. . Other high points on this album, if we can even pick high-points given every cut on the album is a classic, is &quot;Along Came Betty&quot; on side 2 written by Golson. It is perhaps the most sophisticated track on the album with an almost Ellingon-esque horn arrangement. Blakey&#39;s energy lifts the soloists to new heights however, Golson in particular plays out of his skin on this one. If you&#39;re looking for a reminder of why the classics are classics because, maybe, you have become a bit complacent you can&#39;t go far wrong with either Abera Ararso from PLOT nor &quot;Moanin&#39;&quot; from Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. .",

            "title": "Point Of Departure and PLOT Rodrigo Sanchez Valencia",
            "content": "The main impetus behind this blog post is a new coffee I have been drinking recently. . The coffee in question is from the folks at PLOT Roasting ( https://plotroasting.com/ ). I believe they are a relatively new roaster on the scene, starting around the mid-end of 2019 based in Woolwich east London. I&#39;m usually quite suspicious of new roasters and usually like to try their offerings in cafes before purchasing a whole bag. The past few years quite a few sub-par roasters have appeared in London. What made me try PLOT then? For one their website suggested they know what they&#39;re doing and there appeared to be a coherent brand and aim - not a list of specialty cliches. The service was good with quick delivery and a hand written thank you note, which although doesn&#39;t change the drinking experience I appreciate when I see it. The packaging is very nice also, you build up your expectations prior to even viewing the beans so it&#39;s nice to see nice well thought out packaging (although packaging alone will not save a subpar coffee of course!) . The coffee itself I&#39;m writing about today is from Huila, Colombia and is called: Rodrigo Sanchez Valencia. There are 2 main pieces of interest on the spec sheet: the first the varietal is (entirely) pink bourbon - a hybrid between red and yellow bourbons (there also exists another hybrid orange bourbon). This varietal is super-rare and hard to produce so you don&#39;t often see it and when you do it tends to be expensive. PLOT however price this, in my opinion, fairly reasonably - higher than average but not to crazy-Geisha levels. The second point of interest is the processing method: a washed cold fermented processing. Essentially the coffee is picked and pulped then stored to ferment at a low temperature for a few days and then treated as a fully washed coffee would be. This is the first coffee of this processing type I have tried to the best of my knowledge, my instinct tells me to expect the funky notes of a natural but without the &quot;body&quot; and &quot;dirt&quot; you get with a natural. I have to admit I am not a big fan of some of these fancy new processing techniques, while interesting and different I don&#39;t find many to be particularly enjoyable - I often find a certain &quot;hollowness&quot; or &quot;emptiness&quot; to these coffees that sort of reminds me a decaf. . . Into the cup we go, starting with the filter - using my goto rig of the OE Apex, Hasami brewer and chemex paper. The ground beans have a different texture between the fingers from the last few coffees I&#39;ve had, a more jagged and &quot;dry&quot; feeling - I&#39;m not sure if this is directly attributable to the processing, varietal or just coincidence. On the nose the beans give off a very wiry almost vinegar aroma - certainly &quot;different&quot; but not unpleasant. Brewing to my usual recipe the first thing I notice in the cup is a cider smell - like a cloudy &quot;craft&quot; cider as opposed to a mass produced cider. This carries through to the cup, there is a fair amount of acidity present. The sweetness is there but it&#39;s certainly on the acidic end of the scale. The boozy funkiness from the fermentation only amplifies the cider comparisons. The body and mouthfeel are very light and thin, it is certainly an odd experience since the funky notes tend to come with increased body. As an espresso I get much the same qualities, this is certainly not an espresso for those looking for a more traditional and developed espresso (note: I believe PLOT only suggests this for filter - but I like low development espressos). There are some light other fruity notes present with this coffee (the tasting notes suggest pineapple and melon - I&#39;m not sure I really pick out those at least in the first few cups I&#39;ve had so far). . Overall a very interesting, somewhat challenging coffee. I&#39;m certainly glad to have tried this one. I&#39;m also glad that PLOT appears to be a very high-level establishment, I could easily see this coffee being destroyed by a less capable roaster. I&#39;m sure I will be ordering from them again, it&#39;s nice to find another high quality roaster especially in London - I hope they achieve success. . Thinking of an album to pair with this coffee has been a bit of a struggle, I try and somehow link my album recommendation to the coffee somehow - through an idea/thought or through some indirect means. Given the coffee&#39;s qualities in the cup I feel a more avant-garde offering is appropriate - challenging but rewarding. I finally settled upon one of my favourite offerings in this style: Andrew Hill&#39;s Point Of Departure. . . This album was recorded by Rudy Van Gelder, like many of the great Blue Note records. Released in 1965 it features a blockbuster line-up that would challenge any album you care to mention in terms of prestige: Andrew Hill (piano), Kenny Dorham (trumpet), Eric Dolphy (alto sax and flute), Joe Henderson (tenor sax), Richard Davis (bass) and Tony Williams (drums). This is ilustrated by Reid Miles&#39; inimitable artwork where title, artist and supporting cast are given equal size fonts. While not the most creative or iconic Blue Note artwork it certainly still packs a punch. . The music on this cut is typical Andrew Hill - slightly chaotic, partly dense and partly sparse. The opening theme on &quot;Refuge&quot; is a twisting and turning affair that lets you are not in for a &quot;typical&quot; Blue Note hard-bop romp. As was the style for the earlier &quot;free&quot; recordings there is still a fair amount of structure to the composition rather than just a free-for-all -typically following a form of: a theme/phrase to open, an extended modal static section for soloing and then closing with a variation on the opening theme. The themes themselves, however, are looser and more angular than typcially found on bop records often having more dissonance, extended voicings and odd timings. . Of the soloists, as expected, Hill and Dolphy are in their element. The latter in particular producing, in my opinion, some of his best soloing - wild and on the edge of completely losing control yet still having a sense of swing. Dorham in contrast is not somebody who you would expect to see on a date like this, he is best known for his understated deeply melodic and lyrical style. He still brings that quality here but the magic of Hill&#39;s compositions are that this still fits - by dialing back the crazy at some parts and turning it up at others it allows all the musicians to find their voice. This is something that is difficult to do, especially on dates where there are a lot of &quot;star names&quot; vying for the limelight. If you have read my first blog post you&#39;ll know I&#39;m a big Joe Henderson fan, he is allowed to be looser and freerer here than he is on other records - but being surrounded by Hill and Dolphy he acts as a transition between the frenetic of these two and the soulful mastery of Dorham. As he always does showing his mastery as a side-man a fitting into any role you throw at him. . Perhaps the underrated star of this record that pulls the whole thing together is Tony Williams (credited as &quot;Anthony Williams&quot; as he was earlier in his career). During recording of this record he would have only been 19 years old (the other members being in their 30s-40s), which shows what a prodigious talent he was. Williams is probably best known for his later work in jazz-fusion settings where he devloped a very forceful driving drumming style which later influenced Billy Cobham and the likes. On Point Of Depature however he offers up a much more fluid loose style, while not a strong driving sound he controls the mood masterfully - the chemistry with Hill and Dolphy is fantastic having just recorded the equally seminal &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; under Dolphy&#39;s name only a month prior. . My choice track is the opening to side 2 on the vinyl recording: &quot;Spectrum&quot;. The playing and composition are incredible and there is a certain Monk-esque humour to the theme. Coming up to 60 years old this recording sounds like it could have come from any time period. While not the easiest start into the world of jazz it certainly rewards those that make an effort. If you are looking for comforting or easy the coffee and jazz on offer today will not satisfy you. However if you want to open yourself up to something a bit challenging, new and possibly exciting you could do a lot worse than give either of these a try! .",

            "title": "The Intangible Between and Round Hill Rimiro Natural",
            "content": "A bit of an experimental blog post today; yesterday (May 1st 2020) marked the release of the new record from Orrin Evans Captain Black Big Band on Smoke Sessions records: &quot;The Intangible Between&quot;. I&#39;m going to blog my reaction to hearing this album for the first time. If you are looking for a more detailed review this is not going to be it. . . The Captain Black Big Band project is quite interesting to me. Big bands have largely fallen out of favour, there aren&#39;t many bands out there making records. I assume it&#39;s a financially motivated thing: touring with 12 musicians is more expensive than with a trio - you can&#39;t charge four times as much on the door! It makes big band records such as this exciting. The first Captain Black album was released in 2011 and I believe they have 3 out previously before this one. I&#39;ve always been a fan, they tend to be quite a rambunctious group heading towards the &quot;freer&quot; side than your traditional big band. The influence of the Mingus big bands is clearly evident. Around the mid 2010s Orrin Evans joined the Smoke Sessions record label who have put out some of the best jazz of recent years in my opinion. I was a little dis-heartened to see Orrin had joined The Bad Plus, who I&#39;m indifferent towards, but glad to see he&#39;s still releasing music under his own name. As such I am excited to see what this album has in store. . My liquid accompaniment for these preceedings is a naturally processed Burundi called Rimiro, another coffee from the fine folks at the Round-Hill roastery. I normally favour &quot;clean&quot; tastes so I sometimes struggle with naturals that are too funky. Thankfully there is no issue of funk here, it is on the elegant end of the spectrum. Flavour wise in the filter I get a big hit of red-wine, the natural processing leading to the familiar &quot;boozy&quot; notes as they often do. It is fairly refined as a drinking experience with a lot of fruit and acidity in the cup. As an espresso you gain a big mouthfeel and tonnes of body, the red wine is still prominent but there&#39;s a candy-bubblegum sort of vibe that takes over - paired with the mouthfeel it reminds me of a milkshake! A very cool coffee indeed, I have found Burundis have really improved over the past few years. Now it&#39;s one of my favourite origins and often really impresses. Overall I think I marginally preferred the Claude but you cannot go wrong with either of these coffees. Hopefully this is a good omen for the jazz. . The album kicks off with &quot;Proclaim Liberty&quot;, opening with a fairly traditional brass arragement - quickly subsiding into the main theme led by bass and piano. The band makes use of its full ensemble with a lot of rich harmony but as with other Captain Black records when soloing many musicians drop out leaving the soloist space to express themselves. As he usually does Orrin plays with his choppy stacatto piano style. Towards the end of the piece the tempo raises and things get a little more out there, overall a positive start to the album. Listening I couldn&#39;t help but notice a certain similarity to some of the Frank Zappa jazzier offerings (such as &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; and &quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot;) in some of the melodies - no bad thing. . The second track &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot; again makes use of the number of brass instruments, big lush full harmony washes over you. As the name suggests this is a reworking of the gospel classic. The drumming brings a frenetic quality to the whole affair though. This is mirrored in the opening sax solo which has some cool angular lines. Orrin carries on the urgency with an athletic piano solo spanning the instruments range. The outside playing does not feel forced however, it always feels natural. Something that cannot be said for a lot of modern jazz players - it feels modern yet at the same time could have been released at any time. . &quot;A Time for Love&quot; is the third track, as a stark contrast to the raw energy of the previous number it&#39;s time to slow things down. The only word to describe the melody here is beautiful. Nobody is overplaying on this piece, with down-tempo numbers there is sometimes a tendency to throw too much technique at the tune - not the case here. The use of a fender rhodes mid-tune just fits the mood perfectly. This is a very accomplished take on a standard. . The previous tune is just the calm before the storm however as &quot;That Too&quot; starts with a powerful Mingus-esque melody full of attitude and swagger. Again I here some Zappa-isms in the arrangment. At this point in the album, approximately a quarter of the way through, you can tell that they really went for it on this album. This is not a safe album, they&#39;re taking risks and trying to really make a statement - so far it is working. . The next tune is instantly recognisable as &quot;Off Minor&quot; by Thelonious Monk. Orrin&#39;s playing has always reminded me a little of Monk - it&#39;s very rhythmic and choppy in contrast to many other players who play smooth flowing sort of styles. I tend to think covering Monk brings out a lot of joy in the musicians and gives them a chance to playful. That does not seem to be the modus-operandi here however - again they seem to want to make a point. So far this is the most free and outside of the tunes on this album. The tempo modulates up and down through the piece and there is some wild soloing throughout. Very cool! &quot;Into Dawn&quot; brings us back down to reality again, starting off with some much less challenging harmony. The arrangment feels largely similar to the Roy Hargrove original - of course the musicians here throwing the &quot;Captain Black&quot; spin on things. Given the recent (tragic) passing of Roy Hargrove this feels a particularly fitting tribute. . The extended take &quot;Tough Love&quot; begins with a poem - one doesn&#39;t have to look very hard to see the obvious Mingus influence here. The references to black-lives matter, school-shootings and general hate strike a mournful tone, the suggestion the poem suggests that letting in love, while challenging, could change everything. I don&#39;t want to try and unpick the deeper meaning here as I&#39;m unlikely to do this justice on a first listen. I think this will provide a challenging and thought-provoking quality to any future listening. . The last tune on the album is &quot;I&#39;m so Glad I Got to Know You&quot; - it doesn&#39;t take much to uncover the underlying theme of this piece. Evans penned this as a tribute to Lawrence Lo’ Leathers who the jazz community also lost far too early. Starting with a contemplative solo piano intro it breaks into a more upbeat swinging big-band arragement - I presume illustrating the nature of loss. The tune ends with a chorus singing the tracks title - a very fitting and heartwarming end to the album. Overall this album has been a moving and sometimes challenging listen, but the quality is unmistakable. It is certainly worth hunting down through whatever medium you consume your music. I will be giving this another listen (or two) in the coming days. Walking the line between free and more traditional styles is tricky, especially as a big band, but this album shows Orrin knows how to do it. .",

            "title": "Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio and Round Hill Spring Claude",
            "content": "In this blog post I&#39;m going to write about 2 main themes: the first being contentious opinions. . I&#39;m just going to come out and say it: I don&#39;t like Oscar Peterson. I know admitting this will cause the jazz police to come over to my house and beat down my door, but it&#39;s true. I find his playing to rely on too many flashy tricks played at break-neck speed. The music, in my opinion, tends to suffer as a result. Don&#39;t get me wrong I can appreciate what he could do and of course he played with some amazing artists (Lester Young being one such example) - but he just ends up leaving me cold and so I never normally reach for one of his albums. I think in the jazz world we do get caught up in &quot;hero worship&quot; a bit too much, certain players get elevated to god status and can do no wrong. Miles Davis for example, the early stuff is obviously fantastic and he deserves all the praise he gets. But some of the later synthy-pop stuff? You&#39;d be hard pressed to argue some of that has much artistic merit - a player without his reputation would be crucified for it. . On the coffee side I also have a rather contentious opinion: I tend to not be overly impressed with Colombian origins. For me there are (obviously) some great ones but a large number of the coffees strike me as rather &quot;meh&quot;. Also certain areas in Colombia are renowned for their big body, nutty sort of flavour notes - these are not what I favour at all. I look for delicate florals and fruit notes first and foremost. As such it is rare I will order a bag of a Colombian origin given the choice. . This leads me onto the second theme of the day: pleasant surpirses (when they really shouldn&#39;t be surprising at all). . In 1954 Lester Young stepped into the studio with Oscar Peterson (and others) to record the album: &quot;Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio&quot;. A fun fact about this recording: it featured the Oscar Peterson Quartet rather than the trio as the name would suggest. Originally released as 3 seperate albums but has since been combined into 1 volume. Given my relationship with Oscar Peterson I did not listen to this album for years, despite Lester Young being one of my all time favourite artists - more fool me, since the album is fantastic from start to finish. . Lester Young was a curious fellow, he had a rather natty dress sense (with a particular perchant for pork-pie hats). While some of his contemporaries relied on technique and muscling their way through the changes, Lester took a much more laid back approach, sitting right in the pocket and playing relatively few notes with a more lyrical style. This was perfectly exemplified on his recordings with Billie Holiday, their styles blending perfectly. This laid back sax vibe was a reflection of his persona too, very laid back and &quot;cool&quot; - he was known for creating much of the jazz &quot;lingo&quot; of the time which is still being used today (including the term &quot;hipster&quot;). His friends call him &quot;Prez&quot; or &quot;the president&quot;. . The record itself poses an interesting counterpoint: Oscar wanting to up the tempo and play fancy lines while Lester wanting to sit in the pocket. The result is each player compromises - Lester plays some of his fastest most intricate lines on this record and Oscar dials back. It all just works, I would love to have sat in on the session I could have easily seen this going off the rails one way or the other. . We shouldn&#39;t just focus on the 2 named artists however, the &quot;backing&quot; band is also fantastic (and could have lead other dates) featuring Ray Brown on bass, JC Hoard on drums and Barney Kessell on guitar. As a guitarist Barney is one of my favourites, he was very clearly in the Charlie Christian school of jazz guitar (which is no bad thing). On this record he plays some great solos for example on &quot;Tea for Two&quot;. Barney also had one of the best guitar tones I ever heard with his Charlie-Christian pickuped guitars and you can tell he is using one here. . The album itself is almost entirely made up of standards from &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;, &quot;There Will Never be Another You&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot;. On modern reissues there is also a cool outtake &quot;(It Takes) Two to Tango&quot; which features Lester singing (as far as I&#39;m aware the only recorded track of him doing so). If I had to pick one tune to exemplify this recording though I would pick &quot;Just You, Just Me&quot;: Focussing now on this week&#39;s coffee; as you may have guessed it is a Colombian origin from La Vega in Tarqui, Huila. The coffee in question is roasted by Round Hill Roastery ( https://roundhillroastery.com/ ) and is their &quot;Spring Claude&quot; offering. Every season (I beleive) the folks at Round Hill release a &quot;special&quot; coffee in special packages under the &quot;Claude&quot; name. Claude being a cat: You can follow Claude&#39;s exploits on his instagram: https://www.instagram.com/monsieur_claude . As always I opt for the filter roast, I prefer the less developed roasts even for espresso and given a choice I will opt for the filter roast even if it is to be used as an espresso. This coffee is roasted particularly light, I don&#39;t have an agtron/tonino (yet) to measure this however . As a filter you&#39;re not greeted with a very pungent aroma, there are gentle berry type smells but they&#39;re quite mellow. On first sip however you get smacked round the face with sweetness. This is one of the sweetest coffees I&#39;ve had in a while, it has a candy-floss or sugar-syrup vibe. There is also a hit of red berry type flavours, I would describe as a raspberry. It is very easy to drink, a cup can disappear before you&#39;ve even noticed - which is always a good sign. There is some balancing acidity to the sweetness but predominently it is all about the candy. . Being a lighter roast pulling an espresso can be a bit of an issue. With coffees such as these I recommend pulling shots slighltly longer (around 2.25-2.75:1 sort of range) at a higher temperature than normal and quickly! However this coffee is fairly forgiving, it is not particularly acidic so I didn&#39;t end up with any super-sour shots. When dialed in the sugary goodness comes through, however you also have a reasonable amount of body coming through. It really gives off a syrupy vibe. The raspberry note is still there too. . I enjoyed this coffee a lot, more than I expected to given the origin. . However I should really not be surprised by my enjoyment from either the album or the coffee. Lester Young constantly provides inspiration and I find Round Hill one of the most consistently great roasters in the UK. It goes to show that sometimes preconceptions can get in the way. .",

            "title": "Inner Urge - Joe Henderson and Assembly Los Urena",
            "content": "In my bleary-eyed haze of an early morning I paw at the laptop trying to get some music to play. Before my morning coffee my creativity levels are low; I reach for an old favourite: “Inner Urge” by Joe Henderson. This album holds a special place in my heart, it is perhaps the most important album in my jazz appreciation. It was the album that converted my thinking from: “this jazz stuff is quite cool” to a full-blown obsession. I’m not one to believe in fate or superstition but this album was recorded on my birthday (albeit many years before I was born) – which is kind of a neat coincidence. . . It starts with the title track; McCoy Tyner’s powerful opening chord stab sets the tone for the rest of the album. A dark and brooding, contemplative album throughout, all the time walking the fine line between sophisticated bop and chaotic free jazz – Joe with his albums from the mid-60s seamlessly blended these ideas like no one else. As the music is playing I grab a bag of coffee off the shelf, today’s offering is a Costa Rican from the folks at Assembly Coffee ( https://assemblycoffee.co.uk/ ). The coffee is called Los Urena and is a honey processed typica from the Tarrazu region. Opening the bag (some of the nicest packaging in the business for my money), I’m greeted with a warming floral honey aroma. I doubt that this is going to be a big “punch in the face” sort of flavour bomb of a coffee, it is more a refined easy drinking elegance. I move onto preparing the beans. . . The second track is now playing: &quot;Isotope&quot;. This is perhaps my favourite track on the album – it has a joyful playfulness yet angular ugliness to it. When I first heard this, I’d not heard anything like it – little did I know it was penned as a tribute to Thelonious Monk who I got (really) into many years later. Listening back now the Monk-isms are unmistakable an absolute joy to listen to. As the track ends I finish preparing the filter coffee. Giving the cup a cursory sniff, I get mostly the same notes as from the beans – a sweet rich honey and some light florals. I wait a little for the cup to cool down and let the Latin influence of “El Barrio” cries out, Joe’s improvisation is incredible on this track. Others from the era might have played faster or had a more sophisticated sense of harmony but for my money Joe is the best improviser (possibly ever) – his lines are never neat or fall nicely under the fingers, it’s as though there is zero resistance between mind and the instrument. The first sip of coffee acts like a big warm comforting liquid hug. This coffee will never go down as one of the most complex cups, but it is sophisticated. The thing that often strikes me about Assembly roasts is they tend to be very clean (which is a quality I always look for in a coffee) – these honey processed Americans can often get a bit “blurry” tasting but not here, everything is refined and elegant. I am thoroughly enjoying this cup. . Through my years of drinking specialty I usually find that during each year there is one origin that is particularly spectacular, I can only assume that it is down to particular weather patterns in each region – much like certain wine vintages are so sort after. This year it seems like it is going to be Tarrazu Costa Ricans, this is the 2nd this year that has been great. . Finishing up the cup and the next tune begins, a change of pace and a beautiful ballad called “You Know I Care” penned by Duke Pearson. I often think ballads are underappreciated, playing over ballads requires just as much skill as blowing over crazy bop changes. Here Joe shows his lyricism, you can feel every single note and phrase. Not content with playing it straight he throws in a few more angular phrases but they never feel out of place. It’s now time to test how this coffee behaves as an espresso. This coffee is intended to be used as a filter I believe; it is a light but not super-light roast. Being a honey processed American it is quite easy to extract and fairly forgiving. The espresso has some body to it but is not syrup monster like a darker roast would be. Like the filter it is not a flavour bomb but refined and clear, the florals pop a bit more and there is a bit of fruity acidity coming through overall fairly balanced. The flavour notes from Assembly say “Molasses, Blood Orange, Mellow” – I don’t get the blood orange too strongly but don’t disagree with their assessment. . With the clean coffee aftertaste lingering for a few moments the final track is playing: a Cole Porter classic: “Night and Day”. This is not your typical take on the standard though, an up-tempo fire-breathing hard-bop romp through the changes. As the music fades and I’m suitably caffeinated I finally feel ready for the day ahead. .",

          "content": "Hello, and welcome to my new blog: JazzCoffeeStuff. . . As the name suggests this blog is about two of my favourite topics: jazz and coffee (and other “stuff”!) . The specialty coffee business is a difficult one to navigate, I do not feel right in slating any roaster/producer. Coffee choice is personal and just because I do not bond with a coffee doesn’t mean it is “bad”. As such this blog will only feature positive coffee reviews, I do not write about every coffee I drink - only the particularly good ones! . I have no affiliations or monetary interests in any coffee business nor am I paid to review or feature coffees – this is merely a passion project. . I have been an avid jazz fan for a long time and listen to pretty much every type of jazz from the earliest swing through to the latest releases. I want to make jazz more accessible so I will shy away from highly technical analyses (although those are interesting too) – hopefully making it fun and providing an easy introduction to the genre! . In blog posts I try and include album artwork where appropriate – this is done using a fair use law for the purposes of identification. .
