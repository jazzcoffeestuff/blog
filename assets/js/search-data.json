            "title": "Injuries and Long and Short Prince",
            "content": "In this blog we are looking at the last of my (current) order from the Long and Short roastery ( https://longandshort.london/ ) of the last few blog posts. . This time we are travelling to Burundi and the Tangara region. Burundi is a small east African country sharing borders with Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the west/south and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west. Given its shape it is sometimes called the heart of Africa. In recent years I have find Burundi to be one of the main challengers for &quot;most improved&quot; - every year that passes the cup quality seems to improve. Despite its small geographic size I also find great variety in the coffee from the country. . The particular coffee in question is called &quot;Prince&quot; - after Prince Bigayimpunzi who was a significant individual to the history of coffee farming in the Tangara region. As last week the varietal is a Bourbon, in particular red Bourbon. According to googlemaps this coffee was grown around 200km away from last weeks Rwandan &quot;Bingo&quot; - given they&#39;re both Bourbon varietals and naturally processed we would assume that the coffees would be remarkably similar: this is not the case. The Rwandan was polite, refined and not at all funky. In contrast the Burundi Prince is a wild child! . As I like to start with any coffee: on the nose we are punched in the face with berry fruitiness! It is really quite striking and is certainly intense. There are some supporting notes there too, a chocolate-y sort of smell and it gives the impression of &quot;sweetness&quot; but first impressions are this will be an acidity bomb! There is not a huge amount of &quot;funk&quot; on the nose, in fact it&#39;s difficult to really tell it&#39;s a natural. Based on smell alone I might guess it is a washed Kenyan, it gives off that sort of acidic fruit-bomb vibe. . Moving on, as always, to the filter: again I rely on my trusty Hasami Brewer. I&#39;ve not written much about brewed coffee yet in this blog so I will take a brief de-tour to talk about my set up and how I approach filter. . At heart I will always be a &quot;filter-boy&quot; - it is what first attracted me to coffee and is my most common form of coffee. I particularly love it for judging coffees as the coffees really speak for themselves when presented this way. I have tried (and still use) many different types of brewer, drip, pour-over, infusion, you name it! But for many years for me Chemex was king. One thing I always look for in a coffee is cleanliness, that is the quality I hunt down most - it is why I favour (much) lighter roasts than many. The Chemex with the very thick filter papers accentuates this quality in a coffee so it has always been a favourite of mine. If the pour-over world is split into Chemex and v60 fans I am firmly in the former camp! I also think as an item the chemex is a beautiful item to behold and an iconic design - I am a firm believer that we first taste with our eyes. Having a beautiful brewer/decanter and mug will improve how you perceive your coffee. . . However I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with the performance of Chemex brewers. I find them quite finnicky and have a few issues. Most notably is that the &quot;funnel&quot; walls are smooth, this can cause the filter paper to &quot;stick&quot; to the sides and create a vacuum preventing the water from passing through the coffee. The pouring lip is meant to prevent this however it doesn&#39;t always work. It is certainly not an issue that affects every Chemex brew but it happens enough to make you angry when it does. Another issue I have with the Chemex is the glass walls mean heat escapes quickly, I believe the trick to good filter coffee is keeping things as warm as possible but the Chemex makes this a losing battle. Perhaps worst of all however is that the funnel and carafe are joined together and the neck is narrow, trying to clean a Chemex gets frustrating fast and they quickly look tatty. Not to mention how fragile they are, if you drop one it&#39;s likely it&#39;s gone for good! . My solution for a while was to instead use the v60 brewer and carafe but use the thicker Chemex papers. This is a fair compromise, the v60 has swirling &quot;ridges&quot; that reduce the chance of the paper sticking to the walls. You can pick up a plastic v60 cone for very little money so it is cost effective and long lasting. However unless you spend considerably more I don&#39;t find the v60 particularly visually appealing. About a year ago I came across the Hasami brewer, having bought some of their saucers to use for my espresso cups: . . It has a definite &quot;style&quot; but I am a big fan of the way it looks and feels. Like the v60 it has &quot;ridges&quot; (but straight instead of swirling) but they are deeper so if anything more effective. The brewer itself is &quot;insulating&quot; in the sense that it is made of hollow ceramic/porcelain which helps heat retention. It also comes with a &quot;lid&quot; that I like to place on between pours to further prevent heat loss (I&#39;ve not tested the efficacy of this but it makes me feel better!) It is also an easy clean which is a big plus. The Chemex papers provide a good fit. Overall I&#39;m very happy with it (although I do appreciate it is a very expensive brewer not offering much in the way of tangible benefit to a v60!) . My filter technique is generally quite simple and I do not change it very often. With filter I feel that if you&#39;re trying to &quot;dial in&quot; every coffee you&#39;re doing something wrong - you should look for a consistent technique that you can easily repeat. My technique involves (typically) getting the water very hot, I tend to set my kettle to 100c (although for certain coffees I might knock that back a few degrees depending). My grind setting is constant for all coffees, I do not vary it to target a specific drawdown time. I follow a &quot;pulse pour&quot; approach. I like to pour a small amount of water every 15-20s in order to keep the water level low in the brewer - I find this helps keep the extraction levels higher and helps with consistency. Unlike most others I do not favour agitation of the brew; the extraction yield isn&#39;t quite as high but for me the quality improves. The no-agitation approach increases clarity and cleanliness which is generally my main aim. For a typical cup I will use 14-15g coffee and 200g water - this ratio is a little higher than some suggest but it is where I like it, I feel the little extra coffee makes up for the lack of agitation in terms of total extraction but you end up with a cleaner cup out of it. I might pour 40g, leave for 30s then pour 20g of water every 15s as a typical recipe. Between pours I put the kettle back on to heat up if it needs it and I will place the Hasami lid on to reduce the amount of heat loss. . Back onto the coffee in question after this detour into the world of brewing: as a filter this coffee is fairly wild! The acidity is very prominent from the get go. Blackberries and redcurrants come through strong but this is balanced by a chocolate note and a sweet butterscotch taste and mouthfeel. It is an interesting cup for sure, very complex. Of the long and shorts this is my choice as a filter, it is just more &quot;my style&quot;. As is often the case with Burundi&#39;s there is a floral note I can&#39;t quite put my finger on also, I have a hard time describing it and it&#39;s not particularly loud but it is there. . Moving onto the espresso: again this is a wild child! The long and short roast profile again is more developed than my &quot;typical&quot; coffees which makes it very easy to pull shots from. If you wanted a &quot;gateway drug&quot; to the wilder more acidic espressos I don&#39;t think this one would be a bad starting point as it is so forgiving. Again the acidic blackberry-redcurrant notes are in the forefront and are by far most dominant. The acidity offers almost a &quot;drying&quot; experience in the mouth (but not in a bad way). There is enough sweetness to balance things out but it is not something I can really pinpoint down as a &quot;sugar&quot; or &quot;caramel&quot; or &quot;chocolate&quot; its just there to balance things. In terms of mouthfeel and body there is not much to talk about it is fairly &quot;thin&quot; - some may not like that but I&#39;ve never really placed much value on body. It is certainly a clean cup and thoroughly enjoyable. Again there is that floral note lingering in the aftertaste that I wish I could put a finger on, maybe I&#39;ll have to try some more floral tasting foods to try and really dig down into what this &quot;Burundi note&quot; is! . Just as this weeks coffee is a wild-child we also look at a wild album as this weeks jazz pairing: Angles 9 - Injuries. . . I have to admit I do not know a huge amount about the various &quot;Angles&quot; bands (led by saxaphonist Martin Küchen), there are many incarcerations in many &quot;sizes&quot; - this album being a nonet - or nine piece. This places it firmly in the &quot;big band&quot; camp, something I feel is being under-represented currently. This particular album was released in 2014 and was my first exposure to this band. The full personel are: . Alexander Zethson - piano | Andreas Werliin - drums | Eirik Hegdal - baritone sax | Goran Kajfes - cornet | Johan Berthling - bass | Magnus Broo - trumpet | Martin Küchen - alto and tenor sax | Mats Aleklint - trombone | Mattias Ståhl - vibraphone | . The music itself is more at the &quot;free&quot; end of jazz (which in itself is odd for a big-band) - but there is still great focus on creating a groove, this is &quot;free jazz&quot; for those that enjoy getting up on their feet and dancing. Some of the playing is wild and ferocious, intellectually stimulating and challenging. Yet they manage to keep thrings under control by not losing sight of the groove and relying on the occassional minimalist section to allow the music to breathe. This is a great example of why &quot;free jazz&quot; can still rely on great composition. . Angles 9 have a sound completely of their own, you can identify them within a playlist almost instantly. To me this is the sign of a great artist. Their sound is neither too modern nor too dated, it is just right in that sweetspot where you have some familiarity but it is not &quot;boring&quot;. You can tell every musician in the group plays with swagger and has complete confidence in each others abilities, if the musicians were even slightly on edge the whole thing would fall apart into one big mess. . The opening track (embedded above) &quot;European Boogie&quot; is an absolute fire-cracker that sets the stage for the rest of the album. It is bombastic, swinging and with just the right amount of ego. It also shows that this project is not just content on making music, they&#39;re also trying to make a statement as many of the earlier free-jazz adopters were. However unlike the negative outlook many jazz artists take (and rightly so) - this album presents celebration, peace and hope at the forefront. They manage to combine many cultures into the music seemlessly, from the African and Latin inspired percussive beats through European classically inspired melodies. It is &quot;fusion&quot; in the true sense of the word. The track &quot;Eti&quot; is another particular highlight of the album for me, it really captures the celebrative euphoria and just straight having fun. This is punctuated by the more minimalist freer sections, as if to show that &quot;low periods&quot; help accentuate the joy when it is there. What is also remarkable about this track is also the strength of the main theme, the melody itself reminds me of Russian classical pieces in particular. There are not many &quot;free&quot; albums where you will be humming the melody for days after you hear it. There are even fewer free-jazz albums that you feel like dancing too (admittedly a strange sort of dancing!) . The album is released on the Clean Feed record label out of Lisbon, Portugal. In recent years I have found this to be a highly dependable label. I like labels to have their own &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;style&quot;, this is something that the early labels had in spades. You can pick up any Blue Note recording from the &#39;50s-60s and you know what to expect. Cleanfeed does not hark back to the &quot;good old days&quot; trotting out tried and tested music, they&#39;re very ambitious. The music tends to be very free and experimental but never for the sake of it. It also helps that their recording quality is always top notch too, again they&#39;re progressive and modern - they aim for a very &quot;clean&quot; hi-fi quality to recording, not putting any &quot;faux-patina&quot; on during the recording to conjur up nostalgia. Yet the records remain open and warm, never cold nor clinical. Something that&#39;s very hard to do. . All in all &quot;Injuries&quot; can only be described, in this author&#39;s opinion, as a modern masterpiece. I don&#39;t like to make claims of &quot;album of the decade&quot; or similarly grandiose terms but for jazz released in the 2010s this has to be up there in any &quot;best of&quot; list. It is mindboggling to me this album did not get wide recognition. . I will leave with the track from the album: &quot;Ubabba&quot;. It is the least &quot;free&quot; of all the tracks but shows this band can still swing as hard as anybody else out there! Albeit in their very unique styling. After listening to free-jazz it&#39;s often nice to end on something more straight as a pallette cleanser: And there we have it: a wild coffee in Prince from Long and Short and some wild jazz from the boys in Angles 9. .",

            "title": "Fat Albert Rotunda and Long and Short Bingo",
            "content": "In this blog we are sticking with the Long and Short roastery ( https://longandshort.london/ ) from last time. Again we have another natural processed coffee, this time a Bourbon varietal from Rwanda called &quot;Bingo&quot; (with cupping score 87). . Typically Rwanda is known for their washed coffees, so it is a little unusual to find a natural coffee from there - not exceedingly so, but enough to be note worthy. The bourbon varietal is certainly ubiquitous throughout Rwanda however. Coffee varietals are important in the same way grape types are important to wine. From a preservation standpoint varietals are also important for genetic diversity, currently coffee plants are not particularly diverse and so highly susceptible to pests and disease. The creation of new varietals might help coffee survive long term. . Ethiopia is widely regarded as the birthplace of coffee and it is has the highest diversity of varietals (~95% of all varietals can be found in Ethiopia by some estimates). Outside of Ethiopia most coffee varietals can trace back to Yemen where there existed 2 main varietals: Typica and Bourbon (which is itself a mutation of Typica). Essentially every coffee outside of Ethiopia can trace its lineage back to Typica or Bourbon. . Bourbon takes its name from the island of Bourbon (now Réunion) where it was originally grown before being exported by the French to Latin America and Africa. Compared to Typica the Bourbon varietal has a higher yield (although still low yield compared to many other varietals.) Both are renowned for producing good quality coffee, unfortunately both types are highly susceptible to pests and disease which makes them hard to grow. Bourbon is in some sense &quot;the specialty coffee varietal&quot; given its prevelance and enduring popularity. To continue the wine analogy: &quot;Bourbon is the pinot-noir of the coffee world!&quot; The varietal can be further broken down into &quot;red bourbon&quot; (the original bourbon), &quot;yellow bourbon&quot; (a natural mutation of the red bourbon) and more recently &quot;orange/pink bourbon&quot; (another natural mutation). The colour names refer to the appearance of the coffee fruit prior to processing. . Onto Bingo itself: on the nose the beans give off a strong, rich caramel/burnt sugar sort of vibe - certainly enticing! As with the previous Long and Short coffee the roast level is what I would describe as a true medium-light: not a really light delicate filter roast but also not a medium where you start to see &quot;roasty&quot; notes that mask the natural acidity and sweetness in the coffee. As a filter this coffee shows a reasonable amount of complexity, there&#39;s certainly a tea note present which is strong upfront but also lingers as an aftertaste. The caramel note on the nose is also there but plays more of a supporting role. The real intrigue in the coffee is the blend of the sweetness and acidity - on the bag they describe it as &quot;bittersweet&quot; which is a very good description. As an espresso we are treated with a decent amount of mouthfeel and body. With this one I found pulling a little shorter helped stop the tastes getting lost. The flavour profile in the espresso is much like the filter although the caramel note is amplified somewhat and the tea note dialed back (especially in the aftertaste). All in all an enjoyable cup! . One thing we normally associate with natural coffees is &quot;funk&quot;, this coffee is not particularly funky. But this week&#39;s album is: . Originally appearing as the soundtrack to Bill Cosby&#39;s animated special &quot;Hey, Hey, Hey, It&#39;s Fat Albert&quot;. and released in 1969 &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; was Herbie Hancock&#39;s first dalliance with jazz-funk, a sound he would come back to with &quot;Head Hunters&quot; in 1973. Upto this point Herbie was known for his sophisticated harmony in more &quot;classic&quot; jazz settings and for his &quot;fusion&quot; work with Miles. &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; was instead heavily influenced by funk and soul music. . The album features quite a large ensemble cast of: . Herbie Hancock: Piano, Eletric Piano | Joe Henderson: Tenor Sax, Alto-flute | Garnett Brown: trombone | Johnny Coles: trumpet, flugelhorn | Buster Williams: electric, acoustic bass | Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath: drums | George Devens: percussion | . With additional appearances on some tunes. Having such a large core-band really adds to the funk/soul vibe and affords Herbie more freedom in arrangement. Again blog-favourite Joe Henderson appears to provide some fire-breathing solos, the funky backdrop allows him to show off some funky chops and get a little freer. This is Joe&#39;s 3rd appearance in 8 blog posts - no other blog offers as much Joe Henderson per square inch! . The album starts with &quot;Wiggle Waggle&quot; (embedded above), which is an all time classic. It&#39;s a tune I feel many people will recognise but may not attribute to Herbie, like a few other tunes in his repertoire. It is based around a simple 12 bar blues guitar riff with the horns providing embellishments. The music really grooves with an r&amp;b/soul vibe and Joe&#39;s solo is a wild start to an album. If you can listen to this track without, at least, tapping your feet you should probably go to your doctor and get them to check if you&#39;re missing the funk gene. . I usually find jazz artists tend to express themselves in one of three ways: some are melody driven, some are harmony driven and some are rhythmically driven. Herbie is part of a rare breed that is adept at all three and this album displays this. After listening you&#39;ll find yourself humming the melody of some of the pieces and while it&#39;s playing you&#39;ll get intoxicated with the groove. To break up the funk however there are a few harmonically rich jazz pieces. My choice cut being &quot;Jessica&quot; on side 2: Which showcases Herbie&#39;s skill for harmonic composition and arrangement, a piece he revisited on 1977s &quot;V.S.O.P&quot; album. It is one of my favourite Hancock compositions, it is made all the more striking and beautiful on &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; where it is bookended by &quot;Oh! OH! Here He Comes&quot; and the title track - both of which are fat greasy funk grooves through and through. . Another track of note is the 2nd on the first side: &quot;Fat Mama&quot;. The distorted guitar groove with more than a passing resemblance to &quot;Cissy Strut&quot; by The Meters (which was released around the same time). Instead of being pure Meters funk there is more sophistication in &quot;Fat Mama&quot; (as to be expected with Hancock). . Herbie is still out touring regularly and I have been fortunate enough to see him a few times live (I remember a duet gig with Chick Corea being particularly good!) Since he is such an &quot;all-star&quot; in the jazz world I&#39;ve only seen him in larger concert halls, I&#39;d love to get a chance to see him in a more intimate &quot;jazz club&quot; setting, although a gig like that would sell out almost instantly so I may need to take out a mortgage to fund tickets from a tout if that ever happens here in London. . The weather in London today is overcast and grey, strong winds and intermittent rain showers. On days like this you need comforting coffee and uplifting music: Bingo and &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot; it is. .",

            "title": "The Natural Soul and Long and Short Dambi Udo",
            "content": "In this blog post we&#39;re going &quot;natural&quot;. At the moment I&#39;m finding most of the interesting coffees out there, at least the ones catching my eye, are naturals so it seems only fitting to embrace that. . To those that may be new to the coffee world by &quot;natural&quot; we are referring to how the coffee is processed before being roasted. A coffee &quot;bean&quot; is in fact a seed inside a coffee cherry fruit. The job of processing is to remove this fruit so that the beans are dried and ready to roast (and ultimately end up in tasty and delicious drinks). One option is &quot;washed&quot; processing where, as the name suggests, the coffee cherry is removed with water. Of all the processing methods this produces the &quot;cleanest&quot; cup since (essentially) all the cherry is removed. A &quot;natural&quot; processing method however involves leaving the bean inside the coffee cherry longer, typically in the sun. The natural sugars in the fruit ferment during this time. Eventually the fruit is seperated from the seed, producers have some control over how long the drying stage takes which can impact the qualities in the cup. Typically natural coffees are more complex, have bolder and wilder flavour profiles typically at the expense of being &quot;clean&quot;. In some cases where the fermentation stage is particularly long the coffee can take on &quot;funky&quot; characteristics, I tend to associate these with &quot;bruised fruit&quot; or &quot;fortified alcohol&quot; flavour notes. In the extreme they can taste slightly &quot;rotten&quot; which is a bit of a marmite thing, I&#39;ve not found many really funky naturals for a few years though. . The coffee in question this week comes from the Long and Short ( https://longandshort.london/ ) team in Walthamstow East London. I&#39;ve never purchased from these guys before but what caught my eye was an understated aesthetic and some rather high-quality coffees for reasonable prices. Coffee quality is often assessed using an SCA cupping score ranging from 0-100, to be called specialty the coffee needs a score of at least 80. The cupping score is not perfect but I find is a reasonable benchmark if looking at a new roaster. Typically I&#39;ll look for a score of around 87 or higher, this seems a good yardstick for me - going into the 90s typically means spending much much more dropping down to near 80 does not reduce the cost too much, it is a bit of a sweetspot in the diminishing return curve. To sweeten the deal Long and Short offer 20% off a first order if you sign up to their newsletter. Their regular prices are fair but 20% off is unbelievable - I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get much more bang for your buck, they must be selling at cost with the discount. . . The coffee I selected was called Dambi Udo, it is an Ethiopian from the Guji region and has an SCA score of 89. It is worth noting however that a single score like this cannot tell you anything about the flavour profile or even if you&#39;ll enjoy a coffee. If you hate really bright acidic cup profiles regardless of the SCA score a washed Kenyan might not be the one for you! Ethiopian naturals are really a &quot;tale of 2 halves&quot; in my experience - on the one side you get some really elegant fairly clean cups and on the other you can end up with complete madness (one of my most memorable cups of coffee ever was a particularly funky Yirgacheffe natural, it was right on the edge of being too &quot;rotten&quot; tasting but was a really smash in the face of flavours). The Dambi Udo is definitely on the more polite and elegant end of things. . in the interests of honesty this coffee is roasted slightly darker than my typical coffees. It is by no means dark, a medium-light is more of a fair description but I tend to go light to very light in my preferences. However by developing a bit further the acidity can be managed slightly. The result here is a very easy to drink cup that is very balanced, I&#39;m not feeling as though I&#39;m sacrificing anything by going a touch darker than usual. This also makes pulling espresso shots so much easier, I find this coffee incredibly forgiving - it&#39;s basically impossible to pull a bad shot if you get at least within the ballpark of a reasonable &quot;recipe&quot;. I find this one likes to be ground a bit coarser than others (like many natural Ethiopians in my experience) and only a medium sort of heat. I have had good results from pulling very short (1.85:1) to fairly long (2.5:1) - living up to the Long and Short name! . Onto the cup itself. After grinding the beans have a caramel and jammy sort of vibe on the nose for me along with some very delicate floral notes, very enticing. On the eyes the beans are quite clearly natural (I find there is a certain &quot;look&quot; to natural coffees) but on the nose there isn&#39;t a typical natural funk. In the filter we find the natural processing imparting body and mouthfeel which is really satisfying. The flavour profile is fruity though and through, there are tropical fruits like mangos and watermelons but also a blueberry type note. The caramel on the nose goes more to a sugar-syrup or jam in the cup, there isn&#39;t a hint of a &quot;roasty&quot; note. In the espresso I find this coffee amps up the jam even more both in texture and flavour. The floral notes also come out to play, if I had to describe the type I&#39;d suggest elderflower is an apt descriptor. The acidity is not too high at all in my opinion, I could see this being a good gateway for those that find African espresso too acidic. . If you&#39;re looking for a satisfying cup that is complex yet not too challenging I&#39;d certainly recommend the Dambi Udo. Especially for the discounted price it is truly exceptional. I also want to make a couple of shout-outs about Long and Short: . They win the record for the quickest turnaround of an order I can remember. From placing the order I got the tracking information for delivery within 17mins. Very very good! | It is nice to see packaging that is recyclable, many coffee bags are a pain to recycle but these bags can go into regular recycling (with the 2-way valve removed) | . The album in this blog is one slightly (but not massively) under the radar the 1962: &quot;The Natural Soul&quot; by Lou Donaldson. . The cover art is fairly typical in style with the black/white picture being brought to life with a flash of colour and the impactful block lettering. Lou Donaldson albums are somewhat synonomous with featuring beautiful women on the covers, but I believe this is the first one (jazz historians feel free to correct this!) &quot;The Natural Soul&quot; would have been all the more striking at the time for featuring an African-American woman with a &quot;natural&quot; afro hairstyle, kudos to Blue Note records for being willing to create cover art like this. . The music on this album represents one of the first &quot;Soul-Jazz&quot; records that came in the post-bop era for which Lou Donaldson was a major artist. Soul-Jazz focussed less on intense musicianship and blistering lead lines and more on groove taking inspiration from soul and r&#39;n&#39;b. The tunes were mostly variations on a blues or simply a one-chord vamp and the solos were all about blues-y lyricism. . The line-up on this album is simply incredible, Lou on alto, Tommy Turretine on trumpet, Grant Green on guitar, Big John Patton on organ and Ben Dixon on the drums. The Green/Patton/Dixon trio at the time being one of the pre-eminent organ trios around with a reputation for being one of the funkiest/grooviest. . The music presented is firmly in the Soul-Jazz tradition but with more than a foot remaining rooted in the blues. The opening track &quot;Funky Mama&quot; (embedded at the start of this post) is a perfect example with a hard hitting Soul-Jazz groove based around a 12 bar-blues. Most of the compositions take the form of a turnaround - for any musicians wanting to navigate a turnaround this album (along with many in the Donaldson catalogue) is a great place to start. Lou uses simple pentatonic blues phrases to great effect throughout, Green uses his minimalist style to keep the groove going and Big John Patton acts as the rock keeping things moving. To simply label the playing as &quot;simple blues&quot; is a mistake however, there is still plenty of bop virtuosity on display for example in the opening of side 2 &quot;Sow Belly Blues&quot; where the soloists let loose a bit more. Lou Donaldson (nickname &quot;Sweet Papa&quot;) was also known for his humour and this is certainly on display throughout the album with upbeat progressions and jokey expressions (although the music is anything but a joke). I was fortunate enough to see him live a few years ago, at the time he was nearing 90 years old but still put in a hell of a show. He may have needed to sit down, rest and take trips back stage while others were soloing but it was still a memorable gig. His humour was on display that night and he said 2 things that I will always remember: . &quot;This next tune is a Miles Davis number... You know, back when he actually played jazz.&quot; | A long talk about how in his old age his &quot;performance&quot; was suffering and his experiments with viagra (some of which cannot be printed in a family oriented blog like this!) | A great character, great performer and all around nice guy. He no longer performs live (at 93 years old at time of writing) so I feel fortunate to have got a chance to see him. . So if you&#39;re in search of something fairly easy to listen to that doesn&#39;t compromise on musicianship while providing fat grooves: &quot;The Natural Soul&quot; is not a bad way to go about it. .",

            "content": "This weeks jazz album is the 2015 offering from JD Allen: Graffiti. I wanted to feature a more modern offering this time. In jazz it is all too easy to get caught up in history and yearn for the &quot;good old days&quot;, as such many modern artists seem to get overlooked. JD Allen is one such example, in my opinion one of the greatest modern players who deserves much more recognition for the work he is putting out. (This is exemplified by his allmusic.com entry which is woefully sparse and is missing all of his releases post 2013!) . . Seeing jazz being performed live is one of lifes great experiences, it is great listening to the old Blue Note records but nothing compares to the thrill of a great gig. I have seen JD a few times when he has performed in London, everytime a fantastic performance. Some artists rely on stage patter to lift performances, JD (and his group) does not instead letting the music speak for itself. This almost forces you to really pay attention to the music itself and the whole room feels &quot;part of something&quot;. If he is performing in your neighbourhood I&#39;d wholly recommend getting a ticket. . The album itself (Graffiti) is one of my favourites from him. It features Rudy Royston on drums and Greg August on bass, this rhythm section featuring on many Allen recordings upto 2019s &quot;Barracoon&quot; where he brought in some fresh blood. . The music on Graffiti walks that fine line between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot;, sometimes straying to an almost &quot;free&quot; structure but then pulling you back into something more comfortable. However there is a strong backbone of blues to everything to keep you grounded. There is almost a sensation of movement to the music, you can feel yourself being pushed and pulled by some external force as the music weaves between the swinging and the chaotic. . Many modern band leaders like to express themselves through dense harmonic structures, the music can feel somewhat rigid as a result as this closes off many avenues for improvisation since any solo has to essentially be a regimented tap dance to avoid falling down. This can be fun, but Graffiti instead keeps a looser feeling. Instead of relying on harmony for expression JDs music relies on rhythm to make a statement. . One of my favourite cuts on the album is the 2nd track: &quot;Jawn Henry&quot;. Allen&#39;s playing with the use of wolf tones in the main melody and the overall vibe reminds me of Joe Henderson (who is one of my all time favourite players). It has its own thing going however, there is the very evident JD DNA through the whole piece. Rudy&#39;s quite chaotic drumming helps fill the space in the composition and shows off some monster chops. Despite the technicality however Rudy manages to maintain a solid groove and swing which is no mean feat. With so much going on with the sax and drums you need a bedrock to keep things under control and this is where August comes in. You can tell this band is totally comfortable with each other, with music like this it can quickly turn into disaster if the band isn&#39;t tight. The track is a good illustration of the &quot;out but in&quot; vibe that JDs music is all about. . All the tracks on the album are solid, it is very consistent start to finish. It does not feel like any track is there as filler to turn an EP into an LP. The closing track &quot;Disambiguation&quot; reprises the main theme from &quot;Jawn Henry&quot; and acts to tie the whole album together and acts as a resolution leaving the listener satisfied. Some other tracks I particularly enjoy on the album are &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; which has some real swagger to it (and based on the name I assume is a tribute to Sonny Rollins who is clearly an influence). Another piece that sticks out is &quot;Indigo (Blue Like)&quot;, in the liner notes JD says: &quot;the most avant-garde thing that a jazz musician could do today is try to straight up and down swing&quot; and he is totally right. This tune swings hard but with some Monk inflections and humour thrown in along the way, you can tell they had great fun recording this. If you&#39;re looking for some &quot;no-nonsense&quot; hard hitting modern jazz that respects the past but isn&#39;t a prisoner to it; check out &quot;Graffiti&quot; through whichever medium you use to purchase your music. . The coffee this week is the last of my current batch from PLOT a Peruvian: &quot;Panchita Irureta Atipanaku Competition Lot&quot;. It is a fully washed Caturra coffee. Peru is not an origin I naturally gravitate towards, but for any real reason. Maybe it&#39;s just their seasonality coinciding with other origins that I favour. . As a filter you are greeted with a fairly rich and very sweet cup. Notes coming through cherry and a dark forest gateaux sort of vibe. There is also a reasonable amount of mouthfeel, texture and body to the cup. Both the flavour profile and the mouthfeel don&#39;t scream &quot;washed&quot; you would more naturally associate these things with some sort of natural processing, which is kind of interesting. On the acidity scale I would classify it as a medium, leaning more to sweetness than acidity on a sweet-acid scale. It&#39;s certainly an intriguing cup but despite the complexities it is (very) easy to drink and quite satisfying. . I have to admit I have struggled to dial in a great espresso with this coffee. It&#39;s not that the coffee is &quot;unforgiving&quot; (like say a light roast washed Kenyan that ends up like battery acid if you&#39;re not careful) - it is fairly easy to get something nice to drink, but getting it to shine took a bit of work. I&#39;m used to dialing in very light roasts (and this is a filter roast afterall and probably on the lighter end of filters even) - I eventually found something that works but it is a little counter-intuitive. Although this coffee is a light washed I found it better to think of it as a medium roast natural coffee (somewhat mimicking its flavour profile in the filter I guess). . My espresso machine is a Londinium-R lever machine. It is a fairly simple machine based around a spring-loaded lever group. It has the addition of a digital pre-infusion module that allows you to vary the pressure of the pre-infusion stage which is akin to changing the temperature on some other machines. This pre-infusion pressure is the only variable you really have with this machine. Personally I think this is great, I am not a fan of profiling machines in general as I feel you always end up with a sense of &quot;if only I varied XXXX a bit I could make this better&quot; - which leads to a lot of wasted coffee. . . For the bright filter roasts I use for espresso a general rule to follow for the best results is to get the machine very hot and pull a long shot (~2.5:1 typically) quickly (~22s). This does not work for this coffee however, following this procedure and you&#39;re left with something quite muted and flat. The major issue seems to be the heat, this coffee does not like heat at all! I dialed back to a temperature more suited to a medium roast espresso and things began to liven up. I than began to systematically fine the grind up a bit, reduce the volume of the shot and extend the time. I eventually settled on a &quot;typical&quot; espresso recipe of 2:1 in 27s. It&#39;s quite odd to pull a shot like this these days with the sorts of coffee I drink, usually the longest/slowest I&#39;d go is 2.2:1 and 25s and even that is rare. The results of the espresso investigation led me to change my filter technique for this coffee too, I usually set my kettle hot and re-heat between pours. With this coffee I reduced the temperature by 5 degrees celcius and didn&#39;t re-heat, the coffee thanked me for it (but I doubt I&#39;ll be using these settings for my next bag of coffee!) . Once dialled in however the coffee really speaks as an espresso, it&#39;s bold and vibrant with the black forest gateaux hitting you in the face with full force. As in the filter it&#39;s (very) sweet but there isn&#39;t a mountain of acidity. I could imagine this coffee not being too off-putting for those used to a more developed espresso roast, however being roast less means the flavours are incredibly clean. The mouthfeel is quite syrupy with lots of body, again it&#39;s a complex but satisfying affair. . Overall of the 3 PLOT coffees I tried this was (eventually) my favourite espresso of the 3, which is some achievement as they were all great in their own ways. You might need to work at it a bit but I think it&#39;s worth the hassle for the results in the cup! And it is especially to suited to being consumed while listening to JD Allen&#39;s Graffiti. .",

            "title": "Moanin and PLOT Abera Ararso",
            "content": "Following on from the previous blog post; the second coffee from my PLOT order is the Abera Ararso. This is a fully washed Ethiopian coffee from the Yirgacheffe region. Washed Yirgacheffes have become one of the icons of third wave specialty coffee, they tend to have high cup quality and a certain &quot;style&quot;. Over the years we have almost become spoiled by how great they can be. At the moment it&#39;s trendy to have ever more complex fermentations, drying and yeast based processes to gain more &quot;complexity&quot; in the cup - but for me nothing compares to a Yirgacheffe washed coffee. They&#39;re like your favourite jacket that can be dressed up or down, the Yirgacheffe can satisfy your lust for complex flavours yet at the same time is equally suited to when you just want a cup that is easy to drink on a lazy Sunday morning. . This particular example from PLOT is a very floral affair, not the &quot;loudest&quot; coffee you&#39;ll drink compared to say a natural process fruit bomb. However for a floral it still packs a hefty punch. As a filter there is also a fair amount of sweetness in the cup - it reminds me of candied lavender that you get in fancy cocktail bars. The cocktail comparison is probably fairly apt too as the cup oozes of sophistication and elegance. As with most washed Ethiopians there isn&#39;t a whole lot in the way of mouthfeel. As an espresso the florals pop even more especially on the nose - it is a very fragrant espresso. Washed Yirgacheffes are not always favoured for espresso since they can easily get lost in milk and can be a little too polite for some but personally I like them a lot. . On the bag the taste notes are listed as: &quot;Peach, Parma Violets and Bergamot&quot;. I feel these are fairly apt descriptors, the fragrant bergamot notes are particularly prominent to me. I usually try and ignore specifics in flavour notes when choosing coffee to buy, I tend to just look for &quot;trends&quot; for example: is the coffee floral? Stone fruits? Tropical fruits? and so on rather than hunting down a very specific note. I often seen new coffee drinkers post online &quot;I can&#39;t taste the XXXXX note, what have I done wrong?&quot; which I think leads to disappointment. I think the SCA&#39;s attempt to standardize taste descriptors through the flavour wheel is helpful as I feel as though the industry has got a bit carried away in recent years. Can anybody really tell me they can taste the difference between a coffee with a &quot;strawberry&quot; note versus one with a &quot;wild strawberry&quot; note? I feel as though these grandiose descriptors just lead to disappointment and turns more people away than attracts them to specialty. (Note: this is no reflection on PLOT who seem to use reasonable descriptions, it is just a topic that has been on my mind recently). . . One positive trend I&#39;ve seen with Ethiopian coffees in the past year or so is the movement away from the &quot;Heirloom&quot; varietal - for those readers who perhaps aren&#39;t as well versed in their terminology: a coffee varietal is roughly the equivalent to a grape variety in a wine. So while in wine you might have a chardonnay, pinot noir or malbec grape in a coffee you might have typica, red bourbon or caturra varietals. Ethiopia is widely considered the birthplace of coffee and occurs &quot;naturally&quot;, in other regions the coffee plants were introduced. By introducing specific strains and careful farming outside of Ethiopia it is fairly easy to identify the specific varietals on a particular farm. In Ethiopia the coffee plants are much much older, they have naturally evolved over time and so an individual farm may have many different varietals mixed together, some of which may never have even been classified. In the past the industry used the term &quot;Heirloom&quot; to denote an Ethiopian coffee with a &quot;mix&quot; of natural varietals. This is not ideal since different farms can be composed of entirely different varietals yet both be labelled the same. In the past year or so there has been a move to classify these varietals better. In the Abera Ararso from PLOT we have Kume, Diga and Wolisho varietals. Being relatively new names I haven&#39;t yet got a good handle on the characteristics of each - but hopefully in time I can gain a better understanding of these differences. . Since this weeks coffee is a classic, it feels only apt to pick one of the classic albums in Jazz history to pair with it. In this case I have settled on Moanin&#39; by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. . . The Jazz Messengers have a long and complicated history, originally formed via a partnership between drummer Art Blakey and pianist Horace Silver who left after a couple of years to lead solo projects under his own name. Thereafter Blakey became the leader and director of the group (but also released some music under his own name). Under Blakey the Jazz Messengers had a reputation for attracting young talent and &quot;making them stars&quot;. The groups alumni include some of the greatest names in jazz and one would have to include Blakey in any list of &quot;greatest band leaders&quot;. The Blakey mantra to band leading was to find talented youngsters and then &quot;getting out of their way&quot; rather than using the &quot;apprentice&quot; model that other senior band leaders often favour. . On this record the &quot;big name&quot; is Lee Morgan who would have been 20 years old at the time of recording, already having some noteriety from appearing on Coltrane&#39;s &quot;Blue Train&quot; a year or so earlier. However it wasn&#39;t until a few years after the release of &quot;Moanin&#39;&quot; that he became a household name. Although not quite having, in hindsight, the star power of Morgan the other musicians on the record are no slouches either: Benny Golson on tenor sax, Bobby Timmons on piano and Jymie Merritt on the bass. . As with most LPs on the Blue Note record label from the 50s and 60s Moanin&#39; features an iconic cover with the classic Reid Miles block lettering and a rather sombre looking Blakey (who is usually much more upbeat) in a photo by Francis Wolff. The Blue Note DNA runs through to the music too; during this time recording and rehearsal was relatively expensive. As a result many records released on other labels featured track lists mainly consisting of standards that they could record quickly in few takes. In contrast Alfred Lion and Blue Note paid for rehearsal time for the artists which allowed them to be more creative and develop new music. The album here featuring only one standard: Johnny Mercer&#39;s &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; as the final track, and even that has been largely reworked. All other tracks being originals. . The music itself is gutsy, soulful and with a clear influence from blues and gospel music. The late 50s was an interesting time for jazz music in general, be-bop had started to become a little stale. Artists were trying to find a new voice. Shortly after this jazz began to fragment into new sub-genres (as is the case with any music that lasts long enough). Blakey grew up with big bands and later became associated with be-bop groups - through the Jazz Messengers he became one of the figureheads of the hard-bop movement combining some of the hard hitting swing of big band with some of the dense harmonic structures of be-bop. . The album starts off with the title-track penned by Timmons, the opening motif being one of the most powerful and recognisable in all of jazz. Everybody on the record is on top form and they were clearly up for it. From Blakey&#39;s muscular powerful swinging groove, Timmons offering blues-y block chords and Lee Morgan offering up some killer soulful solos offering a glimpse of what is to come in his later career. The whole record has swagger, swing and total confidence - this is important in jazz records, the musicians often take great risks harmonically and played without confidence it leaves the listener on edge. Part of the beauty of jazz is the feeling of being &quot;in safe hands&quot; while doing something completely reckless. . Other high points on this album, if we can even pick high-points given every cut on the album is a classic, is &quot;Along Came Betty&quot; on side 2 written by Golson. It is perhaps the most sophisticated track on the album with an almost Ellingon-esque horn arrangement. Blakey&#39;s energy lifts the soloists to new heights however, Golson in particular plays out of his skin on this one. If you&#39;re looking for a reminder of why the classics are classics because, maybe, you have become a bit complacent you can&#39;t go far wrong with either Abera Ararso from PLOT nor &quot;Moanin&#39;&quot; from Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. .",

            "title": "Point Of Departure and PLOT Rodrigo Sanchez Valencia",
            "content": "The main impetus behind this blog post is a new coffee I have been drinking recently. . The coffee in question is from the folks at PLOT Roasting ( https://plotroasting.com/ ). I believe they are a relatively new roaster on the scene, starting around the mid-end of 2019 based in Woolwich east London. I&#39;m usually quite suspicious of new roasters and usually like to try their offerings in cafes before purchasing a whole bag. The past few years quite a few sub-par roasters have appeared in London. What made me try PLOT then? For one their website suggested they know what they&#39;re doing and there appeared to be a coherent brand and aim - not a list of specialty cliches. The service was good with quick delivery and a hand written thank you note, which although doesn&#39;t change the drinking experience I appreciate when I see it. The packaging is very nice also, you build up your expectations prior to even viewing the beans so it&#39;s nice to see nice well thought out packaging (although packaging alone will not save a subpar coffee of course!) . The coffee itself I&#39;m writing about today is from Huila, Colombia and is called: Rodrigo Sanchez Valencia. There are 2 main pieces of interest on the spec sheet: the first the varietal is (entirely) pink bourbon - a hybrid between red and yellow bourbons (there also exists another hybrid orange bourbon). This varietal is super-rare and hard to produce so you don&#39;t often see it and when you do it tends to be expensive. PLOT however price this, in my opinion, fairly reasonably - higher than average but not to crazy-Geisha levels. The second point of interest is the processing method: a washed cold fermented processing. Essentially the coffee is picked and pulped then stored to ferment at a low temperature for a few days and then treated as a fully washed coffee would be. This is the first coffee of this processing type I have tried to the best of my knowledge, my instinct tells me to expect the funky notes of a natural but without the &quot;body&quot; and &quot;dirt&quot; you get with a natural. I have to admit I am not a big fan of some of these fancy new processing techniques, while interesting and different I don&#39;t find many to be particularly enjoyable - I often find a certain &quot;hollowness&quot; or &quot;emptiness&quot; to these coffees that sort of reminds me a decaf. . . Into the cup we go, starting with the filter - using my goto rig of the OE Apex, Hasami brewer and chemex paper. The ground beans have a different texture between the fingers from the last few coffees I&#39;ve had, a more jagged and &quot;dry&quot; feeling - I&#39;m not sure if this is directly attributable to the processing, varietal or just coincidence. On the nose the beans give off a very wiry almost vinegar aroma - certainly &quot;different&quot; but not unpleasant. Brewing to my usual recipe the first thing I notice in the cup is a cider smell - like a cloudy &quot;craft&quot; cider as opposed to a mass produced cider. This carries through to the cup, there is a fair amount of acidity present. The sweetness is there but it&#39;s certainly on the acidic end of the scale. The boozy funkiness from the fermentation only amplifies the cider comparisons. The body and mouthfeel are very light and thin, it is certainly an odd experience since the funky notes tend to come with increased body. As an espresso I get much the same qualities, this is certainly not an espresso for those looking for a more traditional and developed espresso (note: I believe PLOT only suggests this for filter - but I like low development espressos). There are some light other fruity notes present with this coffee (the tasting notes suggest pineapple and melon - I&#39;m not sure I really pick out those at least in the first few cups I&#39;ve had so far). . Overall a very interesting, somewhat challenging coffee. I&#39;m certainly glad to have tried this one. I&#39;m also glad that PLOT appears to be a very high-level establishment, I could easily see this coffee being destroyed by a less capable roaster. I&#39;m sure I will be ordering from them again, it&#39;s nice to find another high quality roaster especially in London - I hope they achieve success. . Thinking of an album to pair with this coffee has been a bit of a struggle, I try and somehow link my album recommendation to the coffee somehow - through an idea/thought or through some indirect means. Given the coffee&#39;s qualities in the cup I feel a more avant-garde offering is appropriate - challenging but rewarding. I finally settled upon one of my favourite offerings in this style: Andrew Hill&#39;s Point Of Departure. . . This album was recorded by Rudy Van Gelder, like many of the great Blue Note records. Released in 1965 it features a blockbuster line-up that would challenge any album you care to mention in terms of prestige: Andrew Hill (piano), Kenny Dorham (trumpet), Eric Dolphy (alto sax and flute), Joe Henderson (tenor sax), Richard Davis (bass) and Tony Williams (drums). This is ilustrated by Reid Miles&#39; inimitable artwork where title, artist and supporting cast are given equal size fonts. While not the most creative or iconic Blue Note artwork it certainly still packs a punch. . The music on this cut is typical Andrew Hill - slightly chaotic, partly dense and partly sparse. The opening theme on &quot;Refuge&quot; is a twisting and turning affair that lets you are not in for a &quot;typical&quot; Blue Note hard-bop romp. As was the style for the earlier &quot;free&quot; recordings there is still a fair amount of structure to the composition rather than just a free-for-all -typically following a form of: a theme/phrase to open, an extended modal static section for soloing and then closing with a variation on the opening theme. The themes themselves, however, are looser and more angular than typcially found on bop records often having more dissonance, extended voicings and odd timings. . Of the soloists, as expected, Hill and Dolphy are in their element. The latter in particular producing, in my opinion, some of his best soloing - wild and on the edge of completely losing control yet still having a sense of swing. Dorham in contrast is not somebody who you would expect to see on a date like this, he is best known for his understated deeply melodic and lyrical style. He still brings that quality here but the magic of Hill&#39;s compositions are that this still fits - by dialing back the crazy at some parts and turning it up at others it allows all the musicians to find their voice. This is something that is difficult to do, especially on dates where there are a lot of &quot;star names&quot; vying for the limelight. If you have read my first blog post you&#39;ll know I&#39;m a big Joe Henderson fan, he is allowed to be looser and freerer here than he is on other records - but being surrounded by Hill and Dolphy he acts as a transition between the frenetic of these two and the soulful mastery of Dorham. As he always does showing his mastery as a side-man a fitting into any role you throw at him. . Perhaps the underrated star of this record that pulls the whole thing together is Tony Williams (credited as &quot;Anthony Williams&quot; as he was earlier in his career). During recording of this record he would have only been 19 years old (the other members being in their 30s-40s), which shows what a prodigious talent he was. Williams is probably best known for his later work in jazz-fusion settings where he devloped a very forceful driving drumming style which later influenced Billy Cobham and the likes. On Point Of Depature however he offers up a much more fluid loose style, while not a strong driving sound he controls the mood masterfully - the chemistry with Hill and Dolphy is fantastic having just recorded the equally seminal &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; under Dolphy&#39;s name only a month prior. . My choice track is the opening to side 2 on the vinyl recording: &quot;Spectrum&quot;. The playing and composition are incredible and there is a certain Monk-esque humour to the theme. Coming up to 60 years old this recording sounds like it could have come from any time period. While not the easiest start into the world of jazz it certainly rewards those that make an effort. If you are looking for comforting or easy the coffee and jazz on offer today will not satisfy you. However if you want to open yourself up to something a bit challenging, new and possibly exciting you could do a lot worse than give either of these a try! .",

            "title": "The Intangible Between and Round Hill Rimiro Natural",
            "content": "A bit of an experimental blog post today; yesterday (May 1st 2020) marked the release of the new record from Orrin Evans Captain Black Big Band on Smoke Sessions records: &quot;The Intangible Between&quot;. I&#39;m going to blog my reaction to hearing this album for the first time. If you are looking for a more detailed review this is not going to be it. . . The Captain Black Big Band project is quite interesting to me. Big bands have largely fallen out of favour, there aren&#39;t many bands out there making records. I assume it&#39;s a financially motivated thing: touring with 12 musicians is more expensive than with a trio - you can&#39;t charge four times as much on the door! It makes big band records such as this exciting. The first Captain Black album was released in 2011 and I believe they have 3 out previously before this one. I&#39;ve always been a fan, they tend to be quite a rambunctious group heading towards the &quot;freer&quot; side than your traditional big band. The influence of the Mingus big bands is clearly evident. Around the mid 2010s Orrin Evans joined the Smoke Sessions record label who have put out some of the best jazz of recent years in my opinion. I was a little dis-heartened to see Orrin had joined The Bad Plus, who I&#39;m indifferent towards, but glad to see he&#39;s still releasing music under his own name. As such I am excited to see what this album has in store. . My liquid accompaniment for these preceedings is a naturally processed Burundi called Rimiro, another coffee from the fine folks at the Round-Hill roastery. I normally favour &quot;clean&quot; tastes so I sometimes struggle with naturals that are too funky. Thankfully there is no issue of funk here, it is on the elegant end of the spectrum. Flavour wise in the filter I get a big hit of red-wine, the natural processing leading to the familiar &quot;boozy&quot; notes as they often do. It is fairly refined as a drinking experience with a lot of fruit and acidity in the cup. As an espresso you gain a big mouthfeel and tonnes of body, the red wine is still prominent but there&#39;s a candy-bubblegum sort of vibe that takes over - paired with the mouthfeel it reminds me of a milkshake! A very cool coffee indeed, I have found Burundis have really improved over the past few years. Now it&#39;s one of my favourite origins and often really impresses. Overall I think I marginally preferred the Claude but you cannot go wrong with either of these coffees. Hopefully this is a good omen for the jazz. . The album kicks off with &quot;Proclaim Liberty&quot;, opening with a fairly traditional brass arragement - quickly subsiding into the main theme led by bass and piano. The band makes use of its full ensemble with a lot of rich harmony but as with other Captain Black records when soloing many musicians drop out leaving the soloist space to express themselves. As he usually does Orrin plays with his choppy stacatto piano style. Towards the end of the piece the tempo raises and things get a little more out there, overall a positive start to the album. Listening I couldn&#39;t help but notice a certain similarity to some of the Frank Zappa jazzier offerings (such as &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; and &quot;Waka/Jawaka&quot;) in some of the melodies - no bad thing. . The second track &quot;This Little Light of Mine&quot; again makes use of the number of brass instruments, big lush full harmony washes over you. As the name suggests this is a reworking of the gospel classic. The drumming brings a frenetic quality to the whole affair though. This is mirrored in the opening sax solo which has some cool angular lines. Orrin carries on the urgency with an athletic piano solo spanning the instruments range. The outside playing does not feel forced however, it always feels natural. Something that cannot be said for a lot of modern jazz players - it feels modern yet at the same time could have been released at any time. . &quot;A Time for Love&quot; is the third track, as a stark contrast to the raw energy of the previous number it&#39;s time to slow things down. The only word to describe the melody here is beautiful. Nobody is overplaying on this piece, with down-tempo numbers there is sometimes a tendency to throw too much technique at the tune - not the case here. The use of a fender rhodes mid-tune just fits the mood perfectly. This is a very accomplished take on a standard. . The previous tune is just the calm before the storm however as &quot;That Too&quot; starts with a powerful Mingus-esque melody full of attitude and swagger. Again I here some Zappa-isms in the arrangment. At this point in the album, approximately a quarter of the way through, you can tell that they really went for it on this album. This is not a safe album, they&#39;re taking risks and trying to really make a statement - so far it is working. . The next tune is instantly recognisable as &quot;Off Minor&quot; by Thelonious Monk. Orrin&#39;s playing has always reminded me a little of Monk - it&#39;s very rhythmic and choppy in contrast to many other players who play smooth flowing sort of styles. I tend to think covering Monk brings out a lot of joy in the musicians and gives them a chance to playful. That does not seem to be the modus-operandi here however - again they seem to want to make a point. So far this is the most free and outside of the tunes on this album. The tempo modulates up and down through the piece and there is some wild soloing throughout. Very cool! &quot;Into Dawn&quot; brings us back down to reality again, starting off with some much less challenging harmony. The arrangment feels largely similar to the Roy Hargrove original - of course the musicians here throwing the &quot;Captain Black&quot; spin on things. Given the recent (tragic) passing of Roy Hargrove this feels a particularly fitting tribute. . The extended take &quot;Tough Love&quot; begins with a poem - one doesn&#39;t have to look very hard to see the obvious Mingus influence here. The references to black-lives matter, school-shootings and general hate strike a mournful tone, the suggestion the poem suggests that letting in love, while challenging, could change everything. I don&#39;t want to try and unpick the deeper meaning here as I&#39;m unlikely to do this justice on a first listen. I think this will provide a challenging and thought-provoking quality to any future listening. . The last tune on the album is &quot;I&#39;m so Glad I Got to Know You&quot; - it doesn&#39;t take much to uncover the underlying theme of this piece. Evans penned this as a tribute to Lawrence Lo’ Leathers who the jazz community also lost far too early. Starting with a contemplative solo piano intro it breaks into a more upbeat swinging big-band arragement - I presume illustrating the nature of loss. The tune ends with a chorus singing the tracks title - a very fitting and heartwarming end to the album. Overall this album has been a moving and sometimes challenging listen, but the quality is unmistakable. It is certainly worth hunting down through whatever medium you consume your music. I will be giving this another listen (or two) in the coming days. Walking the line between free and more traditional styles is tricky, especially as a big band, but this album shows Orrin knows how to do it. .",

            "title": "Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio and Round Hill Spring Claude",
            "content": "In this blog post I&#39;m going to write about 2 main themes: the first being contentious opinions. . I&#39;m just going to come out and say it: I don&#39;t like Oscar Peterson. I know admitting this will cause the jazz police to come over to my house and beat down my door, but it&#39;s true. I find his playing to rely on too many flashy tricks played at break-neck speed. The music, in my opinion, tends to suffer as a result. Don&#39;t get me wrong I can appreciate what he could do and of course he played with some amazing artists (Lester Young being one such example) - but he just ends up leaving me cold and so I never normally reach for one of his albums. I think in the jazz world we do get caught up in &quot;hero worship&quot; a bit too much, certain players get elevated to god status and can do no wrong. Miles Davis for example, the early stuff is obviously fantastic and he deserves all the praise he gets. But some of the later synthy-pop stuff? You&#39;d be hard pressed to argue some of that has much artistic merit - a player without his reputation would be crucified for it. . On the coffee side I also have a rather contentious opinion: I tend to not be overly impressed with Colombian origins. For me there are (obviously) some great ones but a large number of the coffees strike me as rather &quot;meh&quot;. Also certain areas in Colombia are renowned for their big body, nutty sort of flavour notes - these are not what I favour at all. I look for delicate florals and fruit notes first and foremost. As such it is rare I will order a bag of a Colombian origin given the choice. . This leads me onto the second theme of the day: pleasant surpirses (when they really shouldn&#39;t be surprising at all). . In 1954 Lester Young stepped into the studio with Oscar Peterson (and others) to record the album: &quot;Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio&quot;. A fun fact about this recording: it featured the Oscar Peterson Quartet rather than the trio as the name would suggest. Originally released as 3 seperate albums but has since been combined into 1 volume. Given my relationship with Oscar Peterson I did not listen to this album for years, despite Lester Young being one of my all time favourite artists - more fool me, since the album is fantastic from start to finish. . Lester Young was a curious fellow, he had a rather natty dress sense (with a particular perchant for pork-pie hats). While some of his contemporaries relied on technique and muscling their way through the changes, Lester took a much more laid back approach, sitting right in the pocket and playing relatively few notes with a more lyrical style. This was perfectly exemplified on his recordings with Billie Holiday, their styles blending perfectly. This laid back sax vibe was a reflection of his persona too, very laid back and &quot;cool&quot; - he was known for creating much of the jazz &quot;lingo&quot; of the time which is still being used today (including the term &quot;hipster&quot;). His friends call him &quot;Prez&quot; or &quot;the president&quot;. . The record itself poses an interesting counterpoint: Oscar wanting to up the tempo and play fancy lines while Lester wanting to sit in the pocket. The result is each player compromises - Lester plays some of his fastest most intricate lines on this record and Oscar dials back. It all just works, I would love to have sat in on the session I could have easily seen this going off the rails one way or the other. . We shouldn&#39;t just focus on the 2 named artists however, the &quot;backing&quot; band is also fantastic (and could have lead other dates) featuring Ray Brown on bass, JC Hoard on drums and Barney Kessell on guitar. As a guitarist Barney is one of my favourites, he was very clearly in the Charlie Christian school of jazz guitar (which is no bad thing). On this record he plays some great solos for example on &quot;Tea for Two&quot;. Barney also had one of the best guitar tones I ever heard with his Charlie-Christian pickuped guitars and you can tell he is using one here. . The album itself is almost entirely made up of standards from &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;, &quot;There Will Never be Another You&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot;. On modern reissues there is also a cool outtake &quot;(It Takes) Two to Tango&quot; which features Lester singing (as far as I&#39;m aware the only recorded track of him doing so). If I had to pick one tune to exemplify this recording though I would pick &quot;Just You, Just Me&quot;: Focussing now on this week&#39;s coffee; as you may have guessed it is a Colombian origin from La Vega in Tarqui, Huila. The coffee in question is roasted by Round Hill Roastery ( https://roundhillroastery.com/ ) and is their &quot;Spring Claude&quot; offering. Every season (I beleive) the folks at Round Hill release a &quot;special&quot; coffee in special packages under the &quot;Claude&quot; name. Claude being a cat: You can follow Claude&#39;s exploits on his instagram: https://www.instagram.com/monsieur_claude . As always I opt for the filter roast, I prefer the less developed roasts even for espresso and given a choice I will opt for the filter roast even if it is to be used as an espresso. This coffee is roasted particularly light, I don&#39;t have an agtron/tonino (yet) to measure this however . As a filter you&#39;re not greeted with a very pungent aroma, there are gentle berry type smells but they&#39;re quite mellow. On first sip however you get smacked round the face with sweetness. This is one of the sweetest coffees I&#39;ve had in a while, it has a candy-floss or sugar-syrup vibe. There is also a hit of red berry type flavours, I would describe as a raspberry. It is very easy to drink, a cup can disappear before you&#39;ve even noticed - which is always a good sign. There is some balancing acidity to the sweetness but predominently it is all about the candy. . Being a lighter roast pulling an espresso can be a bit of an issue. With coffees such as these I recommend pulling shots slighltly longer (around 2.25-2.75:1 sort of range) at a higher temperature than normal and quickly! However this coffee is fairly forgiving, it is not particularly acidic so I didn&#39;t end up with any super-sour shots. When dialed in the sugary goodness comes through, however you also have a reasonable amount of body coming through. It really gives off a syrupy vibe. The raspberry note is still there too. . I enjoyed this coffee a lot, more than I expected to given the origin. . However I should really not be surprised by my enjoyment from either the album or the coffee. Lester Young constantly provides inspiration and I find Round Hill one of the most consistently great roasters in the UK. It goes to show that sometimes preconceptions can get in the way. .",

            "title": "Inner Urge - Joe Henderson and Assembly Los Urena",
            "content": "In my bleary-eyed haze of an early morning I paw at the laptop trying to get some music to play. Before my morning coffee my creativity levels are low; I reach for an old favourite: “Inner Urge” by Joe Henderson. This album holds a special place in my heart, it is perhaps the most important album in my jazz appreciation. It was the album that converted my thinking from: “this jazz stuff is quite cool” to a full-blown obsession. I’m not one to believe in fate or superstition but this album was recorded on my birthday (albeit many years before I was born) – which is kind of a neat coincidence. . . It starts with the title track; McCoy Tyner’s powerful opening chord stab sets the tone for the rest of the album. A dark and brooding, contemplative album throughout, all the time walking the fine line between sophisticated bop and chaotic free jazz – Joe with his albums from the mid-60s seamlessly blended these ideas like no one else. As the music is playing I grab a bag of coffee off the shelf, today’s offering is a Costa Rican from the folks at Assembly Coffee ( https://assemblycoffee.co.uk/ ). The coffee is called Los Urena and is a honey processed typica from the Tarrazu region. Opening the bag (some of the nicest packaging in the business for my money), I’m greeted with a warming floral honey aroma. I doubt that this is going to be a big “punch in the face” sort of flavour bomb of a coffee, it is more a refined easy drinking elegance. I move onto preparing the beans. . . The second track is now playing: &quot;Isotope&quot;. This is perhaps my favourite track on the album – it has a joyful playfulness yet angular ugliness to it. When I first heard this, I’d not heard anything like it – little did I know it was penned as a tribute to Thelonious Monk who I got (really) into many years later. Listening back now the Monk-isms are unmistakable an absolute joy to listen to. As the track ends I finish preparing the filter coffee. Giving the cup a cursory sniff, I get mostly the same notes as from the beans – a sweet rich honey and some light florals. I wait a little for the cup to cool down and let the Latin influence of “El Barrio” cries out, Joe’s improvisation is incredible on this track. Others from the era might have played faster or had a more sophisticated sense of harmony but for my money Joe is the best improviser (possibly ever) – his lines are never neat or fall nicely under the fingers, it’s as though there is zero resistance between mind and the instrument. The first sip of coffee acts like a big warm comforting liquid hug. This coffee will never go down as one of the most complex cups, but it is sophisticated. The thing that often strikes me about Assembly roasts is they tend to be very clean (which is a quality I always look for in a coffee) – these honey processed Americans can often get a bit “blurry” tasting but not here, everything is refined and elegant. I am thoroughly enjoying this cup. . Through my years of drinking specialty I usually find that during each year there is one origin that is particularly spectacular, I can only assume that it is down to particular weather patterns in each region – much like certain wine vintages are so sort after. This year it seems like it is going to be Tarrazu Costa Ricans, this is the 2nd this year that has been great. . Finishing up the cup and the next tune begins, a change of pace and a beautiful ballad called “You Know I Care” penned by Duke Pearson. I often think ballads are underappreciated, playing over ballads requires just as much skill as blowing over crazy bop changes. Here Joe shows his lyricism, you can feel every single note and phrase. Not content with playing it straight he throws in a few more angular phrases but they never feel out of place. It’s now time to test how this coffee behaves as an espresso. This coffee is intended to be used as a filter I believe; it is a light but not super-light roast. Being a honey processed American it is quite easy to extract and fairly forgiving. The espresso has some body to it but is not syrup monster like a darker roast would be. Like the filter it is not a flavour bomb but refined and clear, the florals pop a bit more and there is a bit of fruity acidity coming through overall fairly balanced. The flavour notes from Assembly say “Molasses, Blood Orange, Mellow” – I don’t get the blood orange too strongly but don’t disagree with their assessment. . With the clean coffee aftertaste lingering for a few moments the final track is playing: a Cole Porter classic: “Night and Day”. This is not your typical take on the standard though, an up-tempo fire-breathing hard-bop romp through the changes. As the music fades and I’m suitably caffeinated I finally feel ready for the day ahead. .",

The specialty coffee business is a difficult one to navigate, I do not feel right in slating any roaster/producer. Coffee choice is personal and just because I do not bond with a coffee doesn’t mean it is “bad”. As such this blog will only feature positive coffee reviews, I do not write about every coffee I drink - only the particularly good ones! . I have no affiliations or monetary interests in any coffee business nor am I paid to review or feature coffees – this is merely a passion project. . I have been an avid jazz fan for a long time and listen to pretty much every type of jazz from the earliest swing through to the latest releases. I want to make jazz more accessible so I will shy away from highly technical analyses (although those are interesting too) – hopefully making it fun and providing an easy introduction to the genre! . In blog posts I try and include album artwork where appropriate – this is done using a fair use law for the purposes of identification. .
